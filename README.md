# Song-Generation
Project using LSTM character prediction

This is me playing around with an LSTM model and trying to get it generate some new song lyrics
The project was super fun but just simply due to the small dataset that I was using 
the overall quality of the model is pretty limited, however, If you replaced that the text file with a much large
one, and retrained it, the model will be able to generate some awesome lines.

The model was trained twice and I have both of those weights inside the repo if you want to try them out.
You will just need to change the file locations in any of the lines that reference a path.

Thank you for looking at my project!
