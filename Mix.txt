Once upon a time, I still believed in myself
I was happy being me and didn't need any help
And then somebody that I trusted crushed the feelings I felt
I guess a happy never after was the deal I was dealt

True love doesn't have a happy ending
'Cause when it's real, it doesn't ever end
If I did a rewrite, would I change a damn thing?
Would I flip the script or would I do it all again?

Am I the hero, or maybe the villain?
Am I the sidekick, or even the fill-in?
I'll keep going out for every role
In a story that'll never be told
If I wrote you a note, would you ever listen?
If we never met, would you be who I'm missing?
I'll keep writin' till I'm feelin' complete
The story that'll never be we

I been havin' trouble with believin' in love
Ever since the day you left me, it depressed me and thus
I haven't met somebody worth believin' in much
I guess the movies I grew up on didn't teach me enough
Learnin' to grow and go and sew my broken heart up
Doesn't happen in an hour, just like Hollywood does
There's a problem and you solve it, that's the way they taunt us
But how am I s'posed to fix me, if I'm all that I've got?

True love doesn't have a happy ending (No, it doesn't)
'Cause when it's real, it doesn't ever end
If I did a rewrite, would I change a damn thing?
Would I flip the script or would I do it all again?

Am I the hero, or maybe the villain?
Am I the sidekick, or even the fill-in?
I'll keep going out for every role
In a story that'll never grow old
If I wrote you a note, I hope that you'd listen
And if we never met, you'd probably be who I'm missing
I'll keep writin' till I'm feelin' complete
The story that'll never be we
Yeah, we'll never be we

Yeah, we'll never be we

Fuck

If I could go back
Just for a night
I would see the future
And I'd make it alright
Oh darling if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time

Imagine if I never messed up
Imagine if we never even broke up
Imagine if I had the power to control the voices in my head
And I could tell them all to shut the fuck up

Imagine if I never told a lie
Imagine if I knew how to always get it right
Imagine if I wasn't such a coward
And I had the courage hidden somewhere in my heart to look you in the eye

If I could go back
Just for a night
I would see the future
And I'd make it alright
Oh darling if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time

I was thinking like
Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
Lost our love in the mess we made
Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
If tomorrow was yesterday

I wonder if I saw your face again
Would u be a stranger or would we be more than friends?
Would this be the beginning
Or the long and winding road that takes us all the way around until the very bitter end?

Imagine if we never felt fear
Imagine we were brave enough to never hide the tears
Imagine if I didn't have to worry about everything around me
And my sanity was actually here

I just got so caught up in the moment
Didn't even realize we were broken

If I could go back
Just for a night
I would see the future
And I'd make it alright
Oh darling if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time

I was thinking like
Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
Lost our love in the mess we made
Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
If tomorrow was yesterday

I was thinking like
Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
Lost our love in the mess we made
Aye-oh aye-oh aye okay
If tomorrow was yesterday

Imagine what the world be like
If everybody stayed in love
If everybody stayed offline
Imagine what the world be like
Imagine what the world be like

Yeah

Imagine what the world be like
If everybody stayed in love
If everybody stayed offline
Imagine what the world be like
Imagine what the world be like

But until then

If I could go back
Just for a night
I would see the future
And I'd make it alright
Oh darling if life was a movie
I'd hit rewind
Imagine if I knew how to turn back time


Whoa, nobody's home, I'm all alone
Guess I'll just sit here and stare at my phone
When I'm all alone, you don't even know
How bad I'd love to be alone with you

And I could go, put on a hoodie and sweats
And then take a walk to coffee, and get back into bed
But my bed and my head and the heart that you wrecked
In my chest are a mess since the second you left
And I'm lying awake
And impatiently pacing the hallways
And taking the pictures from frames
And arrangements of daisies in vases you made
Are all dead and alone, like I am but I hope that

Maybe I'll forget you someday
But today is just another Monday

So, nobody's home, I'm all alone
Guess it's just whiskey, weed, me, and my phone
I'm on my own, I didn't know
I don't like this feeling at
All that I know is I'm lonely here in my room (in my room, yeah)
And all that I need is somebody who's lonely too
I'd love to be alone with

You and I were king and queen of quiet nights-in
We'd order food and watch a movie and then do it again
But now the castle that we built is just a spot we split rent
And now it's slowly sinking in that I don't have many friends
But when I sleep at night I dream that we is you and I
And when I wake, I'm paralyzed, the bed is frozen on your side
Been sleeping sideways, inside for five days
Been asking my brain who's waking up at your place

I hope I'll forgive you someday
But today is just another Monday

So, nobody's home, I'm all alone
Guess it's just whiskey, weed, me, and my phone
I'm on my own, I didn't know
I don't like this feeling at
All that I know is I'm lonely here in my room (in my room, yeah)
And all that I need is somebody who's lonely too
I'd love to be alone with you, you, you
I'd love to be alone with you, with you, with you
I'd love to be alone with

I know that I've got a couple of voids I could fill
I promise you, one day I will
But if I can avoid them, now, Lord knows, I will
Maybe I'll forget you someday
Hey, baby, maybe one day
Or maybe after Sunday

When nobody's home, I'm all alone
Guess it's just whiskey weed, me, and my phone
I'm on my own, I didn't know
I don't like this feeling at
All that I know is I'm lonely here in my room (yeah)
And all that I need is somebody who's lonely too
I'd love to be alone with you, you, you
All that I know is, I'd love to be alone with you
I'd love to be alone with you, you, you
I've been going crazy, patient waiting, baby, when you coming through
I'd love to be alone with you

Faded red, short sleeves
I can't forget the way you looked without your jeans on
It's in my drawer and you're all I dream, so
I had to let you know you left it here with me

It kills me to admit that I still want this bad
And I try to forget all the feelings I had
But each time that I look in my closet, I can't
'Cause I still got your t-shirt, do you want it back?

I gave you love and all you did was leave first
Then you told me that I shouldn't be hurt
I tried to hide it but it couldn't be worse
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
Something 'bout the way I love you seems cursed
But I've learnt karma tends to be a b-word
So, I hope you get everything you deserve
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

T-shirt, this t-shirt
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

I'd burn it in a fire if I didn't know the smell
I'd burry it six feet deep if that would help
I'd hold onto it longer, but you don't like being held
So, I'd really like to see you so that maybe I could tell you

It kills me to admit that I still want this bad
And I try to forget all the feelings I had
But each time that I look in my closet, I can't
'Cause I still got your t-shirt, do you want it back?

I gave you love and all you did was leave first
Then you told me that I shouldn't be hurt
I tried to hide it but it couldn't be worse
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
Something 'bout the way I love you seems cursed
But I've learnt karma tends to be a b-word
So, I hope you get everything you deserve
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

T-shirt, this t-shirt
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

Maybe this time
You could take one of mine
And maybe this time
Everything would be fine
So maybe tonight
We could run all alright so
Maybe it's time
We should give it a try

I gave you love and all you did was leave first
Then you told me that I shouldn't be hurt
I tried to hide it but it couldn't be worse
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
Something 'bout the way I love you seems cursed
But I've learnt karma tends to be a b-word
So, I hope you get everything you deserve
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

T-shirt, this t-shirt
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt
T-shirt, this stupid fucking t-shirt
You broke my heart and all I got was this t-shirt

I drink my coffee in the morning
I brush my teeth before bed
I fake a smile to keep the sad thought
Out of my head
I sit outside and watch the world spin
I bet you probably moved on
But I still can't seem to sing
Hmm, anything but this song

I've asked my therapist, my mom and dad the same
I've asked my friends and fam, they all say I'm to blame
I've spent all this time pretending I'm okay
Well, I'm not okay

Today might be the day I go insane
The day I go insane
The day I go insane
That'll be the day, today might be the day
The day I go insane

It'll probably be the best day in my life
I'll be rid of all my problems, I'll be rid of my strife
And I can't even fix an issue 'bout you sayin' good night
And I don't even got to worry if I'm wrong or I'm right
And when I argue with my darkest side, it's comin' to light
I'd rather have 'em call me crazy, than have another fight with you
This mind of mine is mine to lose, it's true

I've asked my therapist, my mom and dad the same
I've asked my friends and fam, they all say I'm to blame
I've spent all this time pretending I'm okay
Well, I'm not okay

Today might be the day I go insane
The day I go insane
The day I go insane
That'll be the day, today might be the day

If today's the day I go insane
Please tell my mom and dad I'm not in pain
And tell my sister not to do the same
It's just, these lonely days get lonelier with rain
And then the feelings come and go and pass in waves (Pass in waves)
And I can feel myself start to get swept away (Swept away)
I guess if your heart can break, then your head can do the same (Do the same)
It's hard to explain

Today might be the day I go insane
The day I go insane
The day I go insane
That'll be the day, today might be the day

The day I go insane (Hey, I'm not okay)
The day I go insane (Today, I'll go insane)
The day I go insane (Hey, I'm not okay)
That'll be the day, today might be the day (Today, I'll go insane)
The day I go insane

Yeah, it hurts, but it's true, I shouldn't care, but I do
I hide who I'm inside, like I've got something to prove
But what I've learned is that pretending ends up bad for my health
What's the point of being if I'm not being myself?


Let's watch TV with the sound off
'Cause the news is always bad
Let's be immature and ignorant
'Cause I don't feel like being sad
I wonder if the last generation was better
I wonder if the next one's going to hell
Am I the solution, am I the problem?
'Cause sometimes I can't tell

I don't know what the point is
Just know I've been disappointed
Each night and every mornin'
And I don't wanna play no more

Let's stay in our pajamas
Let's not leave the house
It's been real bad lately
But I feel pretty good right now
With you laying
With me on the couch
Nobody understands us
And I don't understand it
But stay in our pajamas

It's a little overwhelming
When you put it in perspective
That life is just a bunch of memories
That we've tattered and collected
I wonder if the trees think we're all greedy
If the air thinks we're all crooks
If the water thinks we're too needy
If the sun gives us dirty looks

I don't know what the point is
Just know I've been disappointed
Each night and every mornin'
And I don't wanna play no more

Let's stay in our pajamas
Let's not leave the house
It's been real bad lately
But I feel pretty good right now
With you laying
With me on the couch
Nobody understands us
And I don't understand it
But stay in our pajamas

Don't get stressed, don't get dressed
Let's stay in our pajamas
Don't get stressed, don't get dressed
Let's stay in our pajamas
No worries, no cares, don't go down the stairs
I'm here and I'll hold ya
Don't get stressed, don't get dressed
Let's stay in our pajamas

Let's stay in our pajamas
Let's not leave the house
It's been real bad lately
But I feel pretty good right now
With you laying
With me on the couch
Nobody understands us
And I don't understand it
But stay in our pajamas

Wait, wait on me
This weight on me is weighing me
Down, down, down, down we go
And all I know is I'm to blame
So, will you wait?

I thought we were somethin', baby
Are we, or are we nothin', baby?
'Cause yesterday was so chill and wavy
Today you called me, fucking crazy
That was so unnecessary
Got me feelin' blessed and buried
I'm no saint, you no mother Mary
But if we try, results may vary
I've been workin' through the weekends
So, you can sleep and do the seasons
You think that we're losing meanin'
And I think I know the reasons
I think, the universe's just tryin' to test me
Will wait on my plate that you stress me
I try to give you the best me
But just in case you find the next me

Don't you know that I would love to give my life for you?
If you let me, I would love to give my life to you

Will you wait, wait on me
This weight on me is weighing me
Down, down, down, down we go
And all I know is I'm to blame
So, will you wait?

I can't wait to breathe
I can't wait to breathe
I can't wait to breathe, no
I can't wait to breathe
I can't wait to breathe
I can't wait to breathe
I can't wait to breathe

Will you wait, wait on me
This weight on me is weighing me
Down, down, down, down we go
And all I know is I'm to blame
So, will you wait?

I need emotion, Novocaine, I need a numbing of my brain
I need somethin' to take away the remains of your name
I need amnesia for a day and an umbrella for the rain
That hasn't gone away since you said you didn't need me

Lately been thinkin' maybe
There's a place we won't feel so crazy
Then in a hazy mid-morning daydream
I found a shady spot that they saved me

They said, "Come be the newest member of the broken hearts club
We hate every little thing about the people that we love
We're the let-down, we're the lied-to, where the lost go when it finds you
Where the lonely make the lonely feel less lonely, and we're dyin' to
Invite you to stay, and take away the pain
'Cause misery loves company, so hey, what do you say?"

And at first I wasn't sure if there's even a cure
For what I'm feelin', 'cause what I'm feeling's been feelin' more and more absurd
The repeating in my head of every last word that you said
Feels like ever since you left, you still won't leave me

And lately, been thinkin' maybe
There might be a place we won't feel so crazy
For changing the way you made me
And in a daydream, I let them save me

I'm the newest member of the broken hearts club
We hate every little thing about the people that we love
We're the let-down, we're the lied-to, where the lost go when it finds you
Where the lonely make the lonely feel less lonely, and we're dyin' to
Invite you to stay, and take away the pain
'Cause misery loves company, so hey, what do you say?

I guess if you can't beat 'em, join 'em
That's what they always say
Let's go inside, let's coincide
And all commiserate

Singin', we're the newest members of the broken hearts club
We still feel pretty lonely and we wish we didn't, but
We're the newest members of the broken hearts club
And we all kinda hate it, but it's easier than love
Singin', we're the newest members of the broken hearts club
And we still feel pretty lonely and we wish we didn't, but
We're the newest members of the broken hearts club
And we all kinda hate it...

If emotion's a wave, then sad is a tidal
It’s a hell of a ride, but feeling is vital
'Cause if we don't then we won’t know it won't last forever
If we feel together, then we'll feel better

I don't really understand this life
And why we're all here
All I know is, when your hand's in mine
The questions disappear
And I'm less obsessed with the reasons and guessin'
What life had in mind for me all this time
All the ups and the downs seem worth it
Feels like maybe we made it on purpose

You make me feel better
That’s all that I know, head to my toes
You make me feel better
I don’t know what that means, but it's something to me that
You make me feel worth it and shake off the nervous
And wake up with purpose, it’s true
You make me feel better
So, I hope, I make you feel better too

I suppose I could propose, but this is how it comes and goes
And what we know ain't all we know
And all my no's and all my yeses taught me lessons
Overthinkin' second guesses
I don’t usually do this, you know I been through it
Love hasn't been good for my health
But you ain't no plan B and you understand me
And I can't keep my hands to myself

You make me feel better
That's all that I know, head to my toes
You make me feel better
I don't know what that means, but it's something to me that
You make me feel worth it and shake off the nervous
And wake up with purpose, it's true
You make me feel better
So, I hope, I make you feel better too

Ooh, I hope I make you feel better too
Ooh, 'cause I definitely feel better with you

I'm not good at much
Just singin' songs and lovin' you, but
Every time we touch
I know I'm doin' what I'm s'posed to do
I'm not good at much
Just singin' songs and lovin' you, but
Every time we touch
All I wanna be is closer to

You make me feel better
That's all that I know, head to my toes
You make me feel better
I don't know what that means, but it's something to me that
You make me feel worth it and shake off the nervous
And wake up, you're perfect, it's true
You make me feel better
So, I hope, I make you feel better too

Ooh, I hope, I make you feel better too
Ooh, I hope, I make you feel better too
Ooh, I hope, I make you feel better too
Ooh, 'cause I definitely feel better with you

Well, I'm not sold on soulmates
But do believe in twist of fate
I don't believe in shootin' stars
But made a wish and here we are
But what if we're not meant to be?
What if dreams aren't meant for dreams?
Don't believe in being sad
So, would you try to understand, when I ask?

If we fall apart
Who should I call to help me mend my heart?
If feelings fade and go their separate ways
Who'd be my light in dark
Well, I don't know
But what I do know is, I hope they never do
I don't know who I'd be without you

I've always liked the way you think
Try to see your side of things and you asked
What could we be a better yet?
What if we had never met at all?

And if we fall apart
Who would I call to help me mend my heart?
If feelings fade, we go our separate ways
Who'd be my light in dark
Well, I don't know
But what I do know is, I hope we never do
I don't know who I'd be without

You and all your little things
You've taught me love, you make me sing
I wonder if you'll ever know the truth
That you and all the things you do
Put every piece of me into
And if we part forever, I'll be blue
But if we decide to separate
Before I go, I've gotta say that

If we fall apart
I'll be right here to help you mend your heart
If feelings fade, we go our separate ways
I'll be your light through dark
And even though I'll know you're not alone
One thing will still be true
I don't know who I'd be without
How would I even breathe without
I don't know who I'd be without you
Some days I feel like givin' up, givin' in
Losin' hope, losin' friends
I've been trying hard not to lose my breath
Ever since you left, but if this is the end
Went good and good enough, the road is right and rough
You'll always be alright with me
If you ever feel alone, I just wanted you to know
I wrote you this song to sing
It goes like

P.S., I miss you when you feel alone
P.S., I'm with you, wherever you go
P.S., I get you, so, P.S., come home
P.S., I love you, that's all that I know

I've got seeds, 'cause if we reap what we sow
I've planted you a garden where your flowers can grow
I believe in you and me and at the seams we can solve
I've planted you a garden where your flowers can grow

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Will this be forever?
I guess we'll wait and see
Even if we're not together
We'll forever be we

Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I die for you
Sometimes I try
Sometimes I lie for you

And at the end of the day, I feel broken
Cause it's been a couple of days since we've spoken
I don't know why, but I'd give my life for you

Put it all on a line, I'd jump in the fire for you
When you're lonely at night, I'm there on a dime for you

And after all that you said, I was hoping
That you'd be here in my bed, but I'm coping
I don't know why, but I'd give my life for you

You said you would care
You said you'd be there
(Matter of fact)
You said you'd be here
So how come you're not here

Lonely again
So lonely again
How'd I get so lonely again
How'd I get so lonely again
I said I'm lonely again
(I'm so lonely)
How'd I get so lonely again
(I'm so lonely)
I think I'm lonely again
(I'm so lonely)
Would you come hold me again


(I'm so... yeah)

I'm so sad right now
Too late, calm down
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now

I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now

I'm so sad right now
Too late, calm down
If I make it throught the night, Imma be alright, I'm
I'm so sad right now

So long, old friend
We'll meet again
Sometime, somehow
I'm so sad right now

I mis having fun, I miss my mom and dad
I miss being happy, I miss what we had
But most of all I miss the feelings that I used to have
I wish someone could tell me why I'm so fucking sad

Sometimes I get
So sad, I cry
I don't know why
I'm so sad right now

I'm so sad right now
Too late, calm down
I'm so sad right now
I'm so sad right now

It's okay to be sad sometimes
It's okay to be sad sometimes, yeah
It's okay to be sad sometimes
It's okay to be sad sometimes, yeah


I'm gonna get superlit
Only way to get over it
Now that you done me dirty, done me dirty, yeah
I gotta get superlit
I'm gonna get superlit, superlit
Only way to get over it, over it
Now that you done me dirty, done me dirty, yeah
I gotta get superlit

I'm getting superlit on the way to my job
Then I used to pay the bills from my car
They got me the girl that dumped me last month
And I'm stuck paying, her family planned all
Hold the phone right there, just a minute, man
You know you could change shit around in a minute, man
Even though you pushing 'round in that mini van
When you come home you know you're gonna get...
Superlit
Like you ain't never did before
I'm talking Netflix and Nutella on the kitchen floor
And I feel like a got a little luck
And everything is cool until the sun come up
And then it's back to reality, the same old tragedies
Back to my old ways like, "Please, don't be mad at me"
You know it's just a habit when I had traffic
Even bad news got me laughing

I'm gonna get superlit, superlit
Only way to get over it, over it
Now that you done me dirty, done me dirty, yeah
I gotta get superlit

It's superlit that you do what you did to me
'Cause after what you did to me I don't gotta pretend to be...
Superlit
I could be whatever I want
With whoever I want, do anything that I want
When I'm superlit
Breaking down the doritos on my mac and cheese
In the kitchen whipping Martha recipes
And we, superlit
Negative energy will never get the best of me
And you'll never get the rest of me now I'm...
Superlit

We're gonna get super, superlit
We're gonna get over, over it
Now that you done me dirty
Now that you done me dirty
Now that you done me dirty
(Come on)

Let's all get superlit (hey)
We're gonna get super, superlit (hey)
So we can get over, over it (hey)
So we can get stupid superlit
Again, and again

The sunrise is starting a new
But the sunrise has nothing on you
You make my days feel bright
I know everything's alright
As long as you're right here by my side
But when you have to go
I get oh so sad, you know
Even when it's cloudy, I need you around me
Loneliness ain't in my cup of tea

I wish you were here
Now that I've made that clear

This sunset reminds me of you
It's purple, it's pink and it's blue
It's tangerine and all I need
You're all I wanna ever see
This sunset reminds me of you
Does it make you think of me too?
I know that I'm the one that you miss
Even though I'm not the one that you kiss
Reminisce, reminisce, reminisce
Status present with my senses dismissed
You gave me all these memories
But now you're just a memory
Everything you do is addicting as fuck
So everything I do is I miss you as fuck
And everything you do is so distant as fuck
So everything I do is just resist you and fuck
But not everything that pass me
Matter fact I just let one pass me
Cause I was daydreaming of you so nasty
Guess that's why they call me Papi Gnashty
Don't you get it, don't you get it?
I'll meet you in my daydreams if you with it

Nowadays I want to see you in my daydreams
Nowadays I want to see you in my daydreams
Nowadays I want to see you in my daydreams
Nowadays I want to see you in my daydreams

Nowadays I want to see you in my daydreams
Nowadays I want to see you in my daydreams
Nowadays I want to see you in my daydreams
Nowadays I want to see you in my daydreams

Oh-oh-oh, daydreams, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, daydreams, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, daydreams, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, daydreams, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, daydreams, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, daydreams, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, daydreams, oh-oh-oh

Oh really, your parents are out of town?
Well I'll be at your house in a few
And I don't care if we just drive around
As long as I'm next to you
You're tellin me you know of a party
And that it's gonna be gnarly
But girl I'd rather watch Netflix
Cause all I wanna do
Is be alone with you
Cause I think you're the bestest, yeah

I don't care what everyone's doin'
It's just me and you
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't, babe)
And when we're all alone
Think of the things that we could do
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't babe)

And I know you wanna stay long
Cause they just put on your favorite Drake song
And this party's poppin' but I got a better plan
We could fall in love
I don't think that it'll take long
I just wanna chill and sing along to that one song

Sing along to that one song (oh yeah)

And it goes like:
She's in a Smiths tee underneath her flannel
She could drink whatever but she loves Jack Daniels
I wanna get out this party and go home and light some candles
These people are too much for me to handle, yeah

You're sorta hipster, I grew up on punk rock
And I know how to party when I be goin' I don't stop
But tonight, girl I don't want no one else
I want you all to myself
So if you with it let's get it
We could be gone in a minute
Then light it up and we split it, aye
This gon' be a night that you won't be forgettin'
If you get caught we'll tell your dad
You needed help with house sittin' aye

I don't care what everyone's doin'
It's just me and you
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't, babe)
And when we're all alone
Think of the things that we could do
(i got no plans if you don't, babe

And I know you wanna stay long
Cause they just put on your favorite Drake song
And this party's poppin' but I got a better plan
We could fall in love
I don't think that it'll take long
I just wanna chill and sing along to that one song

Sing along to that one song (oh yeah)

Sing along like:
Everybody's got that one song (one song)
Let me sing it to you all night long (night long)
We be makin' love with the lights on (lights on)
It don't matter baby if it's right wrong (right wrong yeah)

So if you leavin' with me
Well then we rollin' in a minute
Baby we gon' see, yeah
Maybe we could kick it
To some Dylan or some Del Rey
Order in some postmates
That's when she say:

I don't care what everyone's doin'
It's just me and you
(I got no plans if you don't, babe
I got no plans if you don't, babe)
And when we're all alone

And I know you wanna stay long
Cause they just put on your favorite Drake song
And this party's poppin' but I got a better plan
We could fall in love
I don't think that it'll take long
I just wanna chill and sing along to that one song

I always see the light way before the dark
And you always see the end way before the start
I've been trying and; finding that things going right
Aren't as simple as everyone told me they would be
I know that you miss me
I'm sorry I'm busy
And; don't make the time
For the things you ask from me

Out of breath
Out of time
Is it your turn?
Is it mine?
I can't sleep tonight
I can't sleep tonight, no
Is it fine, if we find
That in time this isn't right
I can't speak tonight
I can't speak tonight, no

Just make me feel special
And make me feel loved
Make me feel something
Lately life's made me numb
I just want to hold you
For just long enough
So you don't get tired of me telling you
I love you so much

If I take care of you
Who's gonna take care of me
I could just say take care and leave
But I love how you stare at me
I stay cause I'm scared to leave
I'm not prepared to be
Lonely without you see
That just won't feel right
I need you in my life

Out of breath
Out of time
Is it your turn?
Is it mine?
I can't sleep tonight
I can't sleep tonight, no
Is it fine, if we find
That in time this isn't right
I can't speak tonight
I can't speak tonight, no

Just make me feel special
And make me feel loved
Make me feel something
Lately life's made me numb
I just want to hold you
For just long enough
So you don't get tired of me telling you
I love you so much

So don't make me, no
Don't make me go
Don't make me

In a city I don't know
Hit me three times 'fore the show
I need sleep tonight
You'll be in my dreams tonight, tho'

eelings fade when people change
I stayed the same
You played your games
And now we're left with nothing
I'm not okay, but it's okay
Don't walk away
I'll take the blame
Before we're left with nothing
Don't know if I'll be fine without you
I hope I'll be alright without you

I'm tired of:
Fake people, fake smiles, fake hugs
Fake hope, fake friends, fake love
Cuz fake friends are a real waste of time
And fake love is real waste of life
So don't you go texting me
Telling me
Wish you were next to me
Rest in peace
Everything's ending eventually
Best friends can become your enemies

Do we have to talk about it?
You know how I make you feel, right?
You know I'd be lost without you
You never felt something so real, right?
Remember when we ran through all the fountains
In downtown that one night?
Now I'm running away
From the one that I thought was the one, right, cuz

Feelings fade when people change
I stayed the same
You played your games
And now we're left with nothing
I'm not okay, but it's okay
Don't walk away
I'll take the blame
Before we're left with nothing
Don't know if I'll be fine without you
I hope I'll be alright without you

I'm tired of:
Secrets, lies, excuses
Holding back, the truth is -
I act like I don't care, but I wish you did
You used to make me smile, now you make me sick
I wish I didn't waste my time
I wish you didn't change my mind

Do we have to talk about it?
You know how you make me feel, right?
You know that I'm lost without you
I never felt something so real, right?
Remember when we ran through all the lights
In downtown that one night?
Now you're running away
From the one that you thought was the one, right, cuz

Feelings fade when people change
I stayed the same
You played your games
And now we're left with nothing
I'm not okay, but it's okay
Don't walk away
I'll take the blame
Before we're left with nothing
Don't know if I'll be fine without you
I hope I'll be alright without you

(Ahh man)
I hope our feelings don't fade
I know we know we need space
I'm sorry, I know it's late
But I've got something to say
It's gonna be okay, okay tonight
It's gonna be okay, okay
It's gonna be okay, okay tonight
Cuz tomorrow's just a dream away
It's gonna be okay, okay tonight
It's gonna be okay, okay
It's gonna be okay, okay tonight
Cuz tomorrow's just a dream away

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

Hey
I think I might move on to something new
But only if you say that's cool with you
Cause I love all the little things you do (I mean did)
Cause
I begged you to show up
And I asked you to stay
You told me to grow up
So I pushed you away
I tell you "you know what"
And we fought once again
Then we got back together
Who's kidding who, it's a trend
Because
I like being alone
But I don't like being lonely
I like being home
But I don't like being homies
You know I'm so sorry
For making you feel you lost me
We're two unstable enablers
Please try not to be salty
Because
All this time and all these tries
Leave questions open ended
And I would rather die
Than try to live with this resentment
So we could try just one more time
To make sure that we meant it
Or we could cut our losses
Before we blow up and dead it
So

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

Hey
It's okay to say you're not okay
It's not okay to turn and walk away
We've got problems that we need to face
If you love me, then say it
If you trust me, then show it
If you don't mean it, save it
If you do mean it, own it
You gotta be happy alone
To be happy together
You gotta lose something u know
To learn how to get better
I've been working, you've been hurting
I've been curving, you've been swerving
I've been sleeping, you've been creeping
Now you got me creeped, I'm leaving
I think about you
I dream about you
I smile about you
I cry about you
I lie about you
I'm fine without you
I lied that's not true
I'd die without you
Our love is a war, we use words as our weapons
So either you're real or I'm gone in a second
These thoughts that we have and these feelings we kept in
Make resent and regret, upset and a severance
You don't fuck with ultimatums
Have to face it
Loves contagious
Also dangerous
Leaves you damaged
Make it painless
Now don't make sense
Tried to saved it
Please please please

Tell me it's okay
Please please please
Tell me it's okay
Please please please
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
To be happy now
Because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay

Closure
I just wanna give you closure
So maybe I can find some closure
To start over
So now I'm reaching out for closure
I just wanted to come over
And tell you everything I've never told ya
But now it's over

Open ended conversations
Unfulfilled obligations
You say rapping
Ain't an occupation
But God bless you for being patient
I know it's been up and down
I know you've been lost and found
I can see you in that wedding gown
They don't love me
They just love my sound
But I know you the real deal
So I gotta keep it real real
You sex appeal real ill
Used to smoke joints and watch kill bill
And I know, how cliche
I know my words don't mean much
But their all I got
Gotta give it a shot
Closure

Closure
I just wanna give you closure
So maybe I can find some closure
To start over
So now I'm reaching out for closure
I just wanted to come over
And tell you everything I've never told ya
But now it's over

They say breaking up is hard to do
But waking up is harder boo
And moving on is hardest ooh
But this feeling here is nothing new
I'll always have a thing for ya
Even tho I'm not the thing for ya
You know lowkey I miss what we had
Ok, highkey cause I miss you bad
I lost myself while I was tryna find you
I learned to love myself, I'm feeling brand new
And don't you think I don't got nothing to do
But life kinda sucks lonely here without you
Because all I got is me, weed and this music
All you got left is you, him, and me clueless
So I won't waste your time
And I wish you well
But sometimes this still hurts like hell

Closure
I just wanna give you closure
So maybe I can find some closure
To start over
So now I'm reaching out for closure
I just wanted to come over
And tell you everything I've never told ya
But now it's over

You don't get me
So you don't get me
You don't get me
At all

I loved you in the worse way
You couldn't make it to my birthday
And I heard you're doing okay
But I don't listen to the birds say
I was so excited when you moved into my city
Now I'm only wishing that you'd up and leave my city
Cause you used to be my city
Wish you'd never came to the cave, it's a pity
I can't drive without seeing your face
In all the windows of the spots at all our places
Asked my dad, "How long will it take?"
He said, "Maybe forever, but it will get better
Give it some time, then maybe some more
You simply got so much living in store"
I get it, she didn't get me, but my heart is sore
Now I'm seeing what this distance is for

I love you in the worse way
Sent you flowers on your birthday
But I bet you didn't get them
I don't know your new dude's address or if you're with him
So you better leave a message
Cause if I see your number, I'll reject it
And how am I supposed to get my rest in
If you keep testing, checking in, hoping that I ain't blocked you yet
Saddest part is that you were a best friend to me
But now you're nothing more than enemy
Guess that means it wasn't meant to be
But that don't change our memories
You loved me first then convinced me it was right
When I was the just first to hold you through night
So even though I tried, I tried
Now I'm laying here cause I died, I died

Disposable
Disposable
Didn't know it was so
Disposable
Disposable
Didn't know I was so
Disposable
Disposable
Didn't know you were so
Disposable
Disposable
Didn't know we were so

Back when we started out
I was hoping, thinking we could work it out
We were picture perfect
And I never ever missed a moment
Never no doubt
And I tell you tell you tell you
How much I miss you
Thinking that'll solve all your other issues
So I'm lining up the shot and pull the trigger down
Life is kinda lifeless when you're not around
Packing up and leaving to a different town
Distant in the distance naw I mean it
Just return the crown
Every night I'm dreaming and I'm screaming
That we're headed downtown to lil Tokyo
So hit me let me take you now
Maybe a day like that can change it all
I mean like, who else could I call
Capture all these moments then we threw em away
Little prince and princess to the grave

Going going gone
You're moving moving on
It's unfair for you to care only some of the time
I thought you just needed air and then nothing was fine
I know lavender is your favorite smell and color
And how your hair feels whenever you miss a shower
And how our cranes hang in your koreatown tower
And all your deepest thoughts when you're in your darkest hour
If you didn't love me then you leave me alone
And I know it's probably wrong for me to answer the phone
But I'd rather make you smile then leave you lonely at home
Cause it kinda hurts to care but it hurts worse to have you gone
A pictures worth a thousand words
Collage them up to make them hurt
Read you bedtime stories till we're both laying still
And use these memories for the words of my will

Feeling left out
From the right side of your bed
Feeling stressed out over every last word you said
Feelings left now, just a ghost inside my head
Feeling less now cause I know you dream me dead

I been left out, lied to, talked about and used
Stared down and laughed at, while walking out of school
You wanna put the blame on me the feeling's nothing new
You wanna hang more pain on me there's nothing you can do
A moment lasts inside this coffin, I'm buried often
Every time you're calling once you're starting there's no stopping
You know what, I pick my phone up, know you can hear me, just show up and show love, just want you near me
But like does that even feel right cause I don't want you if anyone can hold you all through the night
And is it even fair or worth for me to put up a fight, just to prove that I'm the one and you still leave out of spite
No more broken hearts to fall apart to broken promise, no more playing cards with broken shards with ghosts to haunt us
And we don't gotta put all this care beyond us, but you don't gotta be scared to be honest

Feeling left out
From the right side of your bed
Feeling stressed out over every last word you said
Feelings left now, just a ghost inside my head
Feeling less now cause I know you dream me dead

I thought a lot lately, please
I wanna stop playing these games
Your mom and pops hate me
And now I'm probably not your top choice as you're drinking on the rocks lately ha
I wanna confess, I wanna die when you're brought up by friends, and every night I'm haunted in bed so I cry every drop is a sin
And I think I'm healing again but every feeling I'm feeling is like I'm peeling the skin
Always dealing with women at every show and event but when we're home or if we're out you're on your phone every second
Said that I'm an ass, I said I think you're right
So every conversation turns to basically a fight
Stare into my eyes tell me what you need
As I pray to God that you never leave

Feeling left out
From the right side of your bed
Feeling stressed out over every last word you said
Feelings left now, just a ghost inside my head
Feeling less now cause I know you dream me dead


Get your dose of oxytocin
Take this hit to show emotion
Feel it like you've never felt before
In the dark and in the open
You're not one who knows devotion
Feel it like you've never felt before

So apart when we're together
From the heart of your forever
From the start I knew you better
But I fell for you and I feel for you
When it's night and the only
Lights are the ones we know
Past scars like a knife and it cuts
Right through your lung
Found a tab on my touch and
It ends up on your tongue
What I want from you
Is you to want me too

Get your dose of oxytocin
Take this hit to show emotion
Feel it like you've never felt before
In the dark and in the open
You're not one who knows devotion
Feel it like you've never felt before

I don't like my own hands touchin' anymore
For a moment I think it's you and then I want more
In the morning I still roll over to kiss you on the forehead
I've never been more dead
I didn't mean to force it
Everything that's supposed to be bad makes me feel so good
I know its time to go and I coulda shoulda would
But my little druggy baby your touch is what can save me
So love me like my lady and I'll hold you all I'm saying

Get your dose of oxytocin
Take this hit to show emotion
Feel it like you've never felt before

Crash with me
Crash with me
Crash with me
Fall asleep

Crash with me
Crash with me
Crash with me
Fall asleep

On the 101 at 1:01 and on the run
From the demons in the soul inside the monster you've become
And I should've trusted judgment, something's up and jumped from jump
'Cuz you gave me all the reasons to be leavin', love is love, yeah

This don't feel right no more, no sleepless nights no more
I don't need strife no more, I don't need life no more
Baby I know it's late, but I've got one more thing to say

Crash with me
Crash with me
Crash with me
Fall asleep

Crash with me
Crash with me
Crash with me
Fall asleep

On the 1 at one because the one that was the one
Won the game but lost my love so I was gone before the sun
And I swore that I was safe from all the damage to be done
Heavy my eyes totaled tons, met early demise, hit and run

Driving, flying thru these red lights and all I see is headlights
And you gave me those red lights, those almost kinda dead lights
I'm driving into my fate, I'll make loving you my last mistake

Crash with me
Crash with me
Crash with me
Fall asleep

Crash with me
Crash with me
Crash with me
Fall asleep

Our car crash hearts felt perfect till the impact
And everyone just watched, and karma is the whiplash
Please know I always loved you, all I wanted was your hand
I'm gone but dreaming of you

I hope you understand
I hope you understand
I hope you understand

I wanna hear your voice but I don't wanna respond
Don't really have a choice
Just kind of hit me that you're gone
Haven't spoke for a minute
I have been barely living
I have been... It only feels so fitting
The only care that you were given
Is the loving that I'm currently missing
We made your Wi-Fi-code and it's saved to my phone
Sometimes I type it in the dots just to check if I'm home
Just like E.T. and the stars on your ceiling
Reflect my glow in the dark heart while it's beating and I'm bleeding out
We were 'bout that scream and shout but what was it that we screamed about
With or without couldn't figure what would sting worse
Always wondered who would leave first

Leave a message
When no one else is near you
So no one else can hear you
Tell me everything
Leave a message
When there's no one else around
I don't wanna hear it now but can't seem to turn you down
Leave a...

Sorry I lost you... But I got something to say before I leave
I'm sorry that I miss you, but it's cool, get to see you in my dreams
Thanks for showing me how love feels
Thanks for showing me how loss feels too
Thanks for making me strong when things fall apart
Thanks for the try, at least we had a good start
Just wanted to hold you down but you put me on hold
And I gave you all my heart
And I gave you my soul
Baby, every little thing is gonna be alright
You'll always be on my mind, can't always be in my life
I know one day you'll smile with all the happy you need
I hope one day you'll smile with all the happy at me
I know one day you'll see everything in you that I see
And I hope one day you'll be as happy as you pretend to be

Leave a message

There's ideas we had, that we no longer know
There's places we've been, that we no longer go
There's things we learn, that we don't wanna know
And there's people we love, that we have to let go

I bet you'd wish that you ain't played me now
Played me now
Played me now

I don't think that you can save me now
Save me now
Save me now

You ain't the one that I'm calling baby now
Baby now
Baby now

You only call me when it's raining out
Raining out
Raining out

Been there, done that, seen it all before
Opened all these windows when I closed up all our doors
Spilling your feelings and slipping on these kitchen floors
Try to work it out but working out just got me sore
All your secrets kept in chambers
Close closed doors on my porch, now I'm hanging by hangers
Could've curled your toes instead of pointing them fingers
So now we're back to how we started out... As strangers

I bet you'd wish that you ain't played me now
Played me now
Played me now

I don't think that you can save me now
Save me now
Save me now

You ain't the one that I'm calling baby now
Baby now
Baby now

You only call me when it's raining out
Raining out
Raining out

Been there, done that, seen it all before
Opened all these windows when I closed up all our doors
In your basic car with your basic heart
And we're basically apart in your basic apart...ment
Meant to say something as you walked out the door
I'm so done with all your gimmicks, I ain't begging no more
I love the way you hate me, I hate the way you made me
I love the way you slave me but I hate the way you played me

I bet you'd wish that you ain't played me now
Played me now
Played me now

I don't think that you can save me now
Save me now
Save me now

You ain't the one that I'm calling baby now
Baby now
Baby now

You only call me when it's raining out
Raining out
Raining out

Believe me
I never wanted to be this way
Never wanted to be this fake
Never thought that I'd be this age
And fail so soon
We'll settle down out west
T-shirts from low class outlets
Posters we wish we were
And pictures of favorite stages
Look at the cage I've been caught up in
Look at the way I've been brought up
Look at the pain I called
My God I never wanted it bad enough, well

Bury me in some fashion
In something fashionable
With a procession whose words
Sound like a song I used to know
And never wrote
'Cause it was beautiful and predictable like

How did two feet in the same boat
How did two keys on the same note
If you knew I wish you would've never said so
But we'll go faking it, feeling it
Feeling like we were the realest shit
I don't see it that way anymore
See a mistake anymore

Bury me in some fashion
In something fashionable
With dirt and words that
Sound like a song we used to know
But never wrote
'Cause it was beautiful and predictable like

Oh, oh, all I ever wanted
How'd I ever fail so soon?
Oh, oh, there goes all I ever wanted
How'd I ever fail so soon?
Oh, oh, all I ever wanted
How'd I ever fail so soon?
Oh, oh, there goes all I ever wanted
How'd I ever fail so soon?


Got on the U down to King's Cross Station where the cross kids were smoking in the street
Mr Redundant's got a boy in London asking questions no one had a right to be
Say Hey Mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!
Say Hey Mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!
I saw the crosses of empty cathedrals whose prospects were hanging out in bars
Mrs Facetious' got a man who preaches what the Beatles' believed
Love is ALL YOU NEED!
Say Hey Mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!
Say Hey Mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!
Life called to say
Hello to curlin' up with a bottle, feelin' better than you do, better than you do
What you say?
Here it comes
Well right now I'm a little drunk but I'll let you know, said I'll let you know
Say Mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!
Well the pregame was bad, but the post-man was worse, and the president kept saying shit that we'd already heard so we kept the TV off, and I kept on writing songs that I knew you'd come to hate if you ever knew what they were about
Don't shout at me like I'm across the room when I'm right here, when you're right this time
We'll do better in another life, in another time, with another
Say Hey Mister are they hey hey!
Are dey are dey hey hey!
Ah dey are dey are!
Say!
Hello to curlin up with a bottle, feelin better than you do, better than you do
What you say
Here it comes
Well right now I'm a little drunk but I'll let you know, said I'll let you know
Will you say in time right now we're doin fine but we'll let you know, said we'll you know

Got on the U down to King's Cross Station where the cross-kids were smoking in the street
Mr Redundant's got a boy in London asking questions no one had a right to be

Say we'll get married on a porch in Vegas
We can get hitched and have a couple of kids
And none of them will look at all like us
And our neighbors all will be a bit too much
And you'll live out in the desert with a man you never loved

Is this it?
What you want?
What you wanted?
Do you need love?
Am I enough for you?
In time you'll find I've got my baggage too

Say we'll get famous and we'll die with our names
In every paper, every news report is any consolation
To the people that you love and all the people that you hate
But will love you all the same because you're beautiful

Say you didn't see it, that I saw right through you
Say you didn't mean it that I mean nothing to you
Like you said
Do you believe me?
That I'll be right for you
Say you love me like you used to

We were born splaying in the wreckage
Buried down on birds with stones
I bore my weight upon your shoulders
Water as warm as morning suns
I don't think quite like I used to
I got a bed to call my own
I see stars and painted lies
Broken glass upon your road
Now I'm driving home too soon

Woah woah
Say you love me like you used to

And we'll vacation first class
I'm breaking your fall
You're breaking my ass
You're working all day
Hating on all the bitches at work
You say you're ok
You're faking, fucked up
You drinking all day, you give me a cup
And I'll be damned if we can make it out of this alive, baby

I say I'll be damned if we can make it out of this alive

But is this what you want?
What you wanted?
Do you need love?
Am I enough for you?
In time you'll find I've got my baggage too

Oh and say we'll get famous and we'll die with our names
In every paper, every news report is any consolation
To the people that you love and all the people that you hate
But we'll love you all the same because you're beautiful

Say you didn't see it, that I saw right through you
Say you didn't mean it that I mean nothing to you
Like you said do you believe me?
That I'll be right for you
Say you love me like you used to

Woah
Say you love me like you used to

And we'll vacation first class
I'm breaking your fall
You're breaking my ass
You're working all day
Hating on all the bitches at work
You say you're ok
You're faking
Fucked up!
You drinking all day, you give me a cup
And I'll be damned if we can make it out of this alive, baby!

I say I'll be damned if we can make it out of this alive

But is this what you want?
What you wanted?
Do you need love?
Am I enough for you?
In time you'll find I've got my baggage too

Say we'll get married on a porch in Vegas
We can get hitched and have a couple of kids

Was I born a stone, heavy to hold
And cold in the hands that you left me to warm in the sun
Was I born alone, or have I recently
Developed a propensity to push people away?
Am I okay with that?

Take it any way you want to
She lit a fire in your head, standing with a flower in her hair
And alcohol plus information often makes it, complicated
So you'll hate me, make love
Lately I've spent my days in daydreams waking you, me
Saving every heartbeat, word, line that you ever gave to me
Cause fair is a weather condition

If you're cold, go inside, if you're tired
Go to sleep, if you're weak, come to me
And find shameful company
If you're cold, go inside, if you're tired
Go to sleep, if you're weak, come to me
And find shameful company

We were young, dumb, taking our chance
And making romance and breaking our promises
Trying to be and failing miserably, but am I too late
Or hearts to your spades? If I don't suit you
Then what do you want from me?
So we're not written in the stars but I'm okay with that
I'm okay with anything

Take it any way you want to, she lit a fire in your head
Standing with a flower in her hair, and alcohol
Plus information often makes it complicated
So you'll hate me, make love
Lately I've spent my days in daydreams waking you, me
Saving every heartbeat, word, line
That you ever gave to me, cause fair is a weather condition

If you're cold, go inside, if you're tired, go to sleep
If you're weak, come to me, and find shameful company
If you're cold, go inside, if you're tired, go to sleep
If you're weak, come to me, and find shameful company

I'm not satisfied
With that look up in your eyes
With that face you make when I come down around here lately
Baby I just wanna ride
With the cool kids, kickin' it, watching all the other six
Fools on the interstate
Sugar-shakin', making it, lit like Christmas trees

Light it up, let it glow, let it pull, let it blow
Up and dry
You're up and dry
A hundred suns, hundred notes, easy come, easy go
Up and dry
You're up and dry

Don't you ever feel like you ever wanted anything more
Than everybody, anybody else
Seventeen and bad, was the best you never had and you won't, sins you never said for yourself
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Everybody got a name
Everybody got a number
Seven sins in six frames
Five for the two of us
Three is too much when there's only one love

Here he come, let him know, leave him hung, let him go
Up to dry
You're up to dry
Light it up, let it glow, let it pull, let it blow
Up and dry
You're up and dry

I don't believe that anybody's god ever felt this way
Cause if they had, they never would've made me
They'd say "Hell no!
Wake me up at ten, tomorrow, for my sake, keep the volume down please
Doesn't everybody try to do their best at what they do best and do less of the bad to begin with?
Doesn't leaving me mean a little less if you left my life
But never loved to begin with?
You never loved to begin with
You never loved me
You never loved to begin with
You never loved me

Don't you ever feel like you ever wanted anything more, than everybody, anybody else
Seventeen and bad, was the best you never had
And you won't, sins you never said for yourself
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Everybody got a name
Everybody got a number
Seven sins in six frames
Five for the two of us
Three is too much when there's only one love

Here he come, let him know, leave him hung, let him go
Up to dry
You're up to dry
Light it up, let it glow, let it pull, let it blow
Up and dry
You're up and dry

For the six months you gave
The seventh month you keep
You stay
For six days and the seventh day you'll leave
And every day you're here
I count until you're gone
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

My heart and soul were never mine to own
What you care to die for?
What you care to die for?
We die alone, we'll all die young
What you care to die for?
What you care to die from?
Snow glistens on the ledge, whiskey on the bed
Shake it out and light a cigarette
Miss me when you, you wish you weren't right
Shake me all out if I'm wrong, for you, for you
Shake it all out when I'm gone, I, for you

Is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep, while the earth turns
And his kids learned to say, fuck you they don't, love you
Does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams, where the earth burns?
She cries cause she's nothing like you, is she like you?
What you want from a devil like me, devil like me?
You see the devil don't mean to be evil, he just regrettably forgets to exceed expectation

Holes riddled in your head, little bit of lead
Shake it out and line silhouette
Miss me when you, you wish weren't kind of glad
Shake me all out when you're done, for you, for you
Shake it all out when I'm gone, I, for you

Is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep, while the earth turns
And his kids learned to say, fuck you they don't, love you
Does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams, where the earth burns?
She cries cause she's nothing like you, is she like you?
What do you want from a devil like me, am I like you?

My god, do you even know my name?
Are you changing up your mind over changes
I never made for you? we are no more than we'll ever be
With heaven on my mind, and hell, well I believe
In the stage lights, come down, breaking over me
Heaven is a dream, heaven heaven is a dream
I believed but never would've been, heaven is a dream
Heaven heaven is a dream I

I would do anything for you to love me
Like I'm an American hero, baby
Star-spangled in my manner shaking
Every man's hand in the presidential manor you see
I would do anything to hear you say
There goes an American hero, darling
Call the press and tell 'em all
"He's got a front page picture face with all of the amenities. "

If you really don't mind, take me as I am
Take me as I am, when you get a chance
Take your time, I understand, believe me
When I say I carry all my sins
And I would do anything for you to love me
Call me an American hero
Call me an American hero
Call me an American

I'll leave, if and when you want me to
When and if I've haunted you and if I miss you when you do not
Real talk, do you read fuck-up in my walk?
Do you see fuck-up on my face? do I mean anything at all?
Don't say you love me if you do got nothing
Else to say to me when heaven is a dream
And reality is fictional! fictional!
Constantine and every host of christendom
What carried them, buried them, with every last one of us
America is just a dream
Just a dream, pretty thing
Nothing's ever what it seems
Just a dream, I still scream in my sleep, in my sleep
I still scream that

I would do anything for you to love me
Like I'm an American hero baby
Star-spangled in my manner
Shaking every man's hand in the presidential manor you see
I would do anything to hear you say
There goes an American hero darling
Call the press and tell 'em all
"He's got a front page picture face with all of the amenities. "

If you really don't mind, take me as I am
Take me as I am, when you get a chance
Take your time, I understand, believe me
When I say I carry all my sins
And I would do anything for you to love me
Call me an American hero
Call me an American hero
Call me an American hero
Call me an American hero
Call me an American hero

My baby's a sailboat captain at sea
We don't give a damn we do as we please

My gal is a good one tells me she's mine
Wish I's better lookin'
Baby, don't mind
My gal is a good one tells me she's mine
All I ever wanted was to make you happy

Wish I's better lookin'

Good with a dagger and skilled with a sword
She's all that and more

All I ever wanted was to make you happy
Spit it all out
Anything to make me love you
Any less than I do now
But you're in my head
When we were in your bed
You said, you said "Yeah I'm so fucking sorry for this"

Lord knows if she goes, she's gone
Say you don't mean that
Lord knows if she goes she's gone
Say you don't mean that
La da da da da da

All I ever wanted was to make you happy

Saint Peter sank my boat, in the bank
We'll get married when we're thirty
Singing, "Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma,"
Don't look so sad

Ask Jesus what you want to get from me
But I can't get what I've been living
Singing, "Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma,"
Don't look so sad

'Cause everybody lies sometimes
And some people lie more than everybody else
And everybody dies sometimes
Some gotta live with the lies they made
And I lie with you, but I can't lie for you
Move to Illinois, but they was ill-adore you
Standing at your door, we'll move out and change our names

Just say, "Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma,"
This dream I had...

We raise a pretty baby by the beach
On a hill where nobody can see
Living in time that's balanced as one
Some guy could see (waddup, girl?)

Living in a house just big enough for three. (house)
Growing in a family just old enough to be. (three)
Under a sky that's just like me
It's plain, but it'll cover you, all of your needs, and
If that's enough for you, I'll say..

Just say, "Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma,"
Ain't that nice?

Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey Pretty Momma, Hey Pretty Momma
Don't look so sad

Patiently listnin'
You're keepin' your distance
And I'm still hoping that we can be friends
But if that's too much then I'll ask no more than
This which we've buried

Yes I had one once but I guess she's married
And, yes, I have a photograph
Somewhere
I guess I'll tell you if you really wanna know that bad

Isn't she beautiful?
Isn't she beautiful?
I know, I know
Isn't she

We're all pretty when we die
Prim and pittied in black and white
White oh

Go and put on your perfume
Smile away the afternoon
Noon

Well your brother got married to a faithless heart
And straightened his trunks for angels' voices
Ah ah ah

Shotgun wedding on the porch
On the fifth of May
And everybody sayin' yeah, they'll be okay
They're so great
They're so nice together
You're the happy couple, may you die together

May you prosper 'till you die
Prim and pittied in black and white
White oh

May we dance until it rains
May we drink to hide our shame
Shame oh

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

We're all pretty when we die
Prim and pale in black and white
White oh

Go and put on your perfume
Smile away the afternoon
Noon

Pray for me if you still believe
Sometimes I just feel like nobody's listening
Or moves in a way that I cannot see
Save the music now ringing in my ears

My dreams go bad, baby
My trials, they die lately
My truce they hide, wait
Patiently a circle in my mind
I'm all faded, I'm getting dialated
To the back where the bad, baby, fighting for

Now they're standing in the door
Singing, "That's my shit, that's my shit"
That's what everbody wants some more
Singing, "You may be the death of me"
No disrespect, baby, but that's my shit, that's my shit"
That's what everbody's on the floor for
Singing, "You may be the death of me"

You, you, you, you may be the death of me
You, you, you, you may be the death of me

Didn't even say goodbye, not even half the time
And now I'm here and it's been thirteen years
And I ain't gonna cry 'bout it
I don't know where home is but I suppose it's anywhere I go
That's any good at all
Is that my fault, is that all my fault

My dreams go bad, baby
My trials, they die lately
My truths they hide, wait
Patiently a circle in my mind
I'm all faded, I'm getting dialated
To the back where the bad, baby, fighting for

Now they're standing in the door
Singing, "That's my shit, that's my shit"
That's what everbody wants some more
Singing, "You may be the death of me"
No disrespect, baby, but that's my shit, that's my shit
That's what everbody's on the floor for
Singing, "You may be the death of me"

You, you, you, you may be the death of me
You, you, you, you may be the death of me

Everybody got a mind of their own
And nobody mind following everybody else
I felt it, what's your problem
That's my shit, that's my shit, that's my
Everybody gotta a day where they gotta pay with responsibility
Disappear like honey bees, you
Now what's you problem, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my

I just can't go along if everybody else is doing it
'Cause everybody else is wrong if everybody else is doing it, listen

Everybody got a mind of their own
And nobody mind following somebody else
Sometimes open up your mind to my shit, to my shit, to mine

Pray for me if you still believe
Sometimes I just feel like nobody's listening
Or moves in a way that I cannot see
'Cause the music's still ringing in my ears

As I recall they were standing in the sunlight
Sharpen up your irons and stick 'em in my eyes, cause ya
Had it, had it, had enough babe, had enough this time
Add it, add it, add it up babe, cause the fun don't come where the money ain't kind

Dollar bills, money, money, money got em hungry for the kill, got em hungry for the kill
All the kids come running for the money, got em runnin' by the hundreds, by the millions, by the mil
Keep your head low, keep your head low, unless you're headed over my way, for them
Dollar bills, money, money, money got em runnin', got em runnin', better run, boy, run

You had em, you had em, you had em getting low, you had em walking, towing that line
You mad, you mad, you're trying to forget how you had em getting red with the look in your eyes
Had enough, had enough, had enough babe, had enough this time
Add it up, add it up, add it up babe, got me runnin', got me runnin', got me runnin' before they get my

Dollar bills, money, money, money got em hungry for the kill, got em hungry for the kill
All the kids come running for the money, got em runnin' by the hundreds, by the millions, by the mil
Keep your head low, keep your head low, unless you're headed over my way, for them
Dollar bills, money, money, money got em runnin', got em runnin', better run, boy, run

Dollar bills, money, money, money got em hungry for the kill, got em hungry for the kill
All the kids come running for the money, got em runnin' by the hundreds, by the millions, by the mil
Keep your head low, keep your head low, unless you're headed over my way, for them
Dollar bills, money, money, money got em runnin', got em runnin', better run, boy, run

Picture me counting cards, dear, pick any kind you like
Picture them colored red, dear, black will hold back the light
For the stars in our eyes are just diamonds, broke
Jokes we tell to laugh, dear, laugh to hold back the pain
Pain is in the mind, dear, stars are much the same
Gone in the time it takes the light to reach
In time you'll find we're blind to the things we don't believe
Picture us out in Vegas counting bills before a show
Spending em from New Orleans where we spent the week before
And the stars in our eyes are the lights from the flash
Pictures of us in black, dear, rolling on the red
Carpets laid on concrete counting billboards where we've read
That the stars of our minds shine bright in the dark
Like diamonds, diamonds
Hearts in our cards and our silver strung guitars say hear me when I call, hear me when I come in late
You're wide awake, I'm sorry is not enough, I'm sorry I'm not enough to stay
Faded by, in time with the back of your bed am I that lever you take, that lever you hold
Faded by, in time with the back of your bed am I that levy you break, that levy you hold
Paint me red, paint me red, picture that, picture that
Picture us and God shaking hands just because we can
Like DMC we run this shit, Run DMC what's tricky to get we got
Watch me murder this, watch me murder this
Planes fly due west, and plain in my view is the blame for the fault in our stars, counting cards in the dark
We sit and talk, bleeding it out, believing that all our stars are just diamonds
Hearts in our cards and our silver strung guitars say hear me when I call, hear me when I come in late
You're wide awake, I'm sorry is not enough, I'm sorry I'm not enough to stay
Faded by, in time with the back of your bed am I that lever you take, that lever you hold
Faded by, in time with the back of your bed am I that levy you break, that levy you hold
Faded by, in time with the back of your bed am I that lever you take, that lever you hold
Faded by, in time with the back of your bed am I that levy you break, that levy you hold
Picture me counting cards, dear, picture me counting cards

I know your type, black lights and leather tights
You're black ice on the road on a drunken summer night, but
I got your number, your name, and your will to fight
Will you be coming over? Will you be coming? Reckon you might
I cannot care, I cannot care for you, I cannot bear to love you any less than you need
I cannot hold you, I cannot bear to lose the bruises that you leave

If you let go of me I'd be a fool to let you, fool to let you leave
Drunk on love or anything so strong as to drive the blood to make way for more, for
More when you've forty-four left, forty for your children beg for the breath that you won't give
And your boyfriend stands to wait all for you, drink up you're wasted on me
Drink up you're wasted

Running that money ma, living lose, playing hard
Damned if I'm gonna lose it, damned if I'm gonna lose it
And you're runnin low, chink in your glass and a knock at the door
What you looking at me for, what you looking at, me

I cannot care, I cannot care for you, I cannot bear to love you any less than you need

I cannot hold you, I cannot bear to lose the bruises that you leave
If you let go of me I'd be a fool to let you, fool fool to let you leave
Drunk on love or anything so strong as to drive the blood to make way for more, for
More when you've forty-four left, forty for your children beg for the breath that you won't give
And your boyfriend stands to wait all for you, drink up you're wasted on me
Drink up you're wasted
Drink up I'll wait


Not whole, not wholly separate, but syncopated, single in our nature
And because of the times, not a word was said when the lights came on
Or a glace given pause at the cost of our desired wrongs
It's second nature to love you, but it's first to die
And we were killed upon waking, killed upon waking to the life
We weren't prepared to live, but rebelled to realize
We were killed upon the pavement, Bonnie we're immortalized in

Blood and cold, cold love, we were still young when the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
If I cry in your arms, it's just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with
I'd die in your arms, bury me while playing this
Bury me saying: "You were all I ever needed"
And hold me like we're dying from the liquor that we drank down in hotel rooms
To feel warm in cold love

What's harder, harder to say?
That you want me to stay, or that you want me stay unchanged for you?
Chained to a lie, we're the same you and I, we're the same
Well not the same, we hurt differently, but consistent in our pain
Equal and equidistant in the way we laugh to lay bear the weight of our cold love affair
Recalling the days where we were, we weren't, we were
Wrong for the papers, wrong for the dinner tables of the inner rings of the rich and famous anything's
It's gone, not bad, just gone, my bad, just wrong, we had, and we had, and we were then in

Blood and cold, cold love, we were still young when the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
If I cry in your arms, it's just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with
I'd die in your arms, bury me while playing this
Bury me saying: "You were all I ever needed"
And hold me like we're dying from the liquor that we drank down in hotel rooms
To feel warm

What's harder, harder to say?
That you want me to stay, or that you want me stay unchanged for you?
Chained to a lie, we're the same you and I, we're the same
What's harder, harder to fake?
That you want me to stay, or that you want me stay the same for you?
Chained to a lie. Who's to blame? Let it die. We're the same

In blood and cold, cold love, we were still young when the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air

What you want me to say? I ain't got nothing left for you. Nothing left to lose, save let loose
Ends lie still, cause you still look good when you lie to me, and anything in-between
How you gon do me like that when you walk so bad? Walk so bad, lady
Love it when you lean like that and you look so bad, walk so bad, (no)
Lay it down hard, and you ante up babe, she's addicted to the prettier things, and all but
Over you, over you, over. Baby what you got to lose? Come

Stay with me, leave it on the low, but lady don't
Lie to me, no you really don't, really don't
Hurt so bad, hurt so bad, when you move your lips, move your body like I'm all
Over you, over you, over. Baby what you got to lose? Come
Stay fly, lady lie with me (Oooh)
You're bourbon in my eyes, a bird in my hands
A bird in my hands, bourbon to my head
A bird in my eyes, a flight risk

Lying on my come-up, we're hung up on these nights
Hung over knees like you needed the relapse
You need this, need that, need it when you can't have
Whatchu wanna do about it? Whatchu gonna take back?
How you gon do me like that when you walk so bad? Walk so bad, lady
Love it when you lean like that and you look so bad, walk so bad, (no)
Lay it down hard, and you ante up babe, she's addicted to the prettier things, and all but
Over you, over you, over. Baby what you got to lose? Come
Stay with me, leave it on the low, but lady don't
Lie to me, no you really don't, really don't
Hurt so bad, hurt so bad, when you move your lips, move your body like I'm all
Over you, over you, over. Baby what you got to lose? Come
Stay fly, lady lie with me
Stay fly, lady lie with me
You're bourbon in my eyes, a bird in my hands
A bird in my hands, bourbon to my head
A bird in my eyes, a flight risk lying

You said I'll come back, I'll come back for you my love, wait for me
You said you're the only, you've been the only one I love, and love believes
But love is a bird that you kept in your coat, warm until it died in the dark
And death is the love of what hurts you the most
So you drink your day away till you're warm as paradise

I'm not hurt I'm broken, but I called to say I'm fine
And I heard you had another love, but I'd love you to think I don't mind
The baby in your arms ain't mine, but I made believe as though it was
And I didn't mean to call this late but I think I'm in love
With the thought of us

So you drink your day away till the liquor in your mouth laughs
And mirrors paint you beautiful like older photographs
But we grow, we grow old, even this won't last
No one understands, no one cares at all
And they're tearing down our sacred places in the hall
You know I hate to dance, still you ask, still you ask for my hand

I love you like the kids love throwing bottles of the bridge
And breaking in to trade your fix for American shoes
For American shoes, I've been dying to lie awake in a room for two
I'll come back, I'll come back for you my love
But love is a bird that you kept in your coat, warm until it died in the dark
And death is the love of what hurts you the most
So you drink your day away till you're warm as paradise

I'm not hurt I'm broken, but I called to say I'm fine
And I heard you had another love, but I'd love you to think I don't mind
The baby in your arms ain't mine, but I made believe as though it was
And I didn't mean to call this late but I think I'm in love
With the thought of us

And I love you like the kids love throwing bottles of the bridge
And breaking in to trade your fix for American shoes
For American shoes, I've been dying to lie awake in a room for two
I'll come back, I'll come back for you my love

Listen in it isn't when you're talking for your name's sake
Jesus, Mary Magdalene you are, are you okay?
Sitting by the well, Jill, your falling down the hill, Jack
And everybody laughed, Don't you pray? Don't you pray?

To a Cocaine Jesus in a black four-seater
Got a man, don't need him, but you wait
Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it
If you only ever need it for the day
High won't hold, won't hold, and I have no more, than all you left of me
I have, I have, I have no more, than all you leave

High as hell, feeling fine, nothing bad but nothing kind
Not a word from me, at least nothing you would mind
In my head, in my head I get lonely sometimes
Feeling fine, coming down, never back cause we're never out
You'll never call the cops again, I'll never call her mine
In my head, in my head, I get lonely sometimes
When you find an old picture of us, and you clear away the dust
I hope you miss me sometimes
When you see a frame that reminds you of me, would you remember the times
Oh the times that we believed
In a Cocaine Jesus in a black four-seater
Got a man, don't need him, but you wait
Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it
If you only ever need it for the day
High won't hold, won't hold, and I have no more, than all you left of me
I have, I have, I have no more, than all you leave

I'm nothing more than a page unwritten on the pavement, blowing in the wind
You win a lot, and lose just a little bit more than you gained in the end
God, I wish that I, was better than I am, but no luck, no love, no Gospel I could understand
I'm nothing that ever wanted to lean on, yea, but even then
When you find an old picture of us, and you clear away the dust
I hope you miss me sometimes
When you see a frame that reminds you of me, would you remember the times
Oh the times that we believed
In a Cocaine Jesus in a black four-seater
Got a man, don't need him, but you wait
Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it
If you only ever need it for the day, today
I'm just a page unwritten on the pavement, you needed 'til you left
But I'm more than a need or a thing you believe or a word that you leave unsaid

Outta town girls, they all just want a chance to see the cityscape, lead a looser game with
All the town boys, they all just want a chance with 'em, I understand you can
Bet your bare bones, she'll be coming back for more
And what for? Should've called, should've wrote, leave a note for her before you close that door
For some closure, you know she told ya she loves the way you speak
To her in the margins of a postcard she keeps from you

Where are the marks of your failed arts? Have your daydreams been keeping you clean?
You never say what you need to make me believe you're the one that means it
I hope it ain't you, I hope it ain't you to let me down, don't fail me now I'm running thin
And I've just begun to wonder when you'll let me in, in, in, in, in

I've got Jesus in my eye, and the Devil in the corner making rye whiskey and gin
Don't you say that ain't him, you should've seen him when he came in
He said: The Yankees played today, they played, but in the eighth the Sox, they clutched the game
At least the Mets are getting laid, yea, that's what they say
Bet your bare bones, everybody everywhere is coming to your party
Man I heard this was the place to be, not a lot that you can't get for free here

Where are the scars of your failed arts? Have your daydreams been keeping you clean? (No!)
You never say what you need to make me believe you're the one that means it
I hope it ain't you, I hope it ain't you to let me down, don't fail me now I'm running thin
And I've just begun to wonder when you'll let me in, in, in, in, in

Twenty years to see New York reflected on subway trains
'Bout twenty more I'll be forty-four, head back to Tampa Bay
I killed a man there, in spite, and when he died, I took his place
Eighteen made you callous to the kisses that you gave
A coarse exchange, a cause for blame, and I stood out in the rain
You killed a man there, and I cried, but the rain masked the hurt behind your face
By the way dear we're alive, and it hurts 'cause we survived it

Goodbye love, and good luck in life, and goodnight Chicago, die with a smile
You'd have loved her, loved her, but you won't, you don't know, no no no no no no
Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't wait until I drown to save me from it
Goodnight Chicago, I killed a man to make you love me

If the water's warm, filling up my head, I take
Another one, Lord knows it's hard to stay
Sober! When heaven's in your past and you have hell to pay
Slower, I'm hung over, but I'm sorry that I'm late
Eighteen made you callous to the kisses that you gave
In one more I stood out in the rain

Goodbye love, and good luck in life, and goodnight Chicago, die with a smile
You'd have loved her, loved her, but you won't, you don't know, no no no no no no
Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't wait until I drown to save me from it
Goodnight Chicago, I killed a man to make you love me

Twenty years to see New York reflected on subway trains
'Bout twenty more I'll be forty-four, head back to Tampa Bay
I killed a man there, in spite, and when he died, I took his place
But don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't wait until I drown to save me from it
Goodnight Chicago, I killed a man, I killed a man, I
Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't shut down on me now, don't shut down on me
Don't wait until I drown to make it right
Goodnight Chicago, goodnight Chicago
Goodnight Chicago, goodnight

The colder the night, the warmer your hands hold
Held in your arms, the hole in my head grows whole

I don't wanna to die alone, but I don't wanna die at all
I'm not gonna keep you by the phone, dear, hang up when you've had enough
Too much to talk
(Oh) Call me when you're coming down, call me when you hang
(Oh) All is well that ends well, but all is well that ends

Clocks made God from the monsters in my head
Do you wanna know my name? Is that all you want to take from me?
In your arms the end is in my eyes, and I don't want to die in my sleep when you're left
(Oh) Call me when you hang and
(Oh) Call me when you're left
(Oh) Call me when you come down, call me when you hang

I don't wanna to die alone, but I don't wanna die at all
I'm not gonna keep you by the phone, dear, hang up when you've had enough
Too much to talk
(Oh) Call me when you're coming down, call me when you hang
(Oh) All is well that ends well, but all is well that ends
(Oh) Call me when you hang
(Oh) Call me when you
Hang your head and cry if you like, but all is well that ends

How do you take so much and leave nothing for the morning?
And think nothing of it? Think of nothing but this
This is that, this is that sleep on glass till you bleed
Wade up to your knees in ash, lookin for the very last
Ain't no-one gonna come and save you, and pull you out now
Ain't no-one gonna come and save you, and pull you out

Beneath your lips lies the trick of it, babe
For a couple licks you can get your fix and more, pick any dream you want
Stay in denial for the shit that gets you shaking in your car
To come and see me like: lately, I've been fucking up hard
And I hate it when you lie in the thick of it all

Your heart. There it goes. Step up, and track down somebody who knows
How to give a fuck about your black, black bag
I know all the combinations of your cool imagined compromise, your time expired
You're driving me to drink, and I'm running a little low
No matter where you go, no matter where you're going

I can't take you there, I can't guess to get you home
Playing catch-up to the moon, I'd say we're getting pretty close, so
Will somewhere darker be a little more like you?
I can't take you there, I can't guess to get you home
Playing catch-up to the moon, I'd say we're getting pretty close, so
Will somewhere darker, with a little more bite do?
Ain't nobody gonna come and save you, and pull you out now
Ain't nobody gonna come and save you, and pull you out

Beneath your lips lie the trick of it, babe
For a couple licks you can get your fix and more, pick any dream you want
Stay in denial for the shit that gets you shaking in your car
To come and see me like: lately, I've been fucking up hard
And I hate it when you lie in the thick of it all
Countdown 'til you come off your rails
And it ain't going well
You've been running up bills
You had to cancel your cards for shooting out street lamps while shooting at stars
Now your credit is falling

Heard it booming at parties, whispered in homes
The pundits on the radio won't leave it alone
I heard it once, heard it twice
Heard it well enough to tell
They say the Mission To Mars, is destined to fail now

Climb down to the edge of your rope
Got a letter 'bout a month ago from control
They say we're coming down hard
We locked our keys in our cars
Or got booted at bars and now the movement is lost

So we blowing up God's phone
Pray he get us off hold soon
Bought our own space but our asses are frozen
Blow enough smoke to punch a hole in the ozone
And all you say is 'we should've stayed home'

Fading, faded, we never made it, faded
Traded for your replacement
Faded we never made it
Watchu tryna be lately?

Climb down to the edge your seat
They say that viewership for launch is up by 50 this week
We changed the format completely, cut the filler for meat
It's just blood on your TV making killings for free
The ticket lines are past the sign down at the end of the street
Meet and greet, VIPs go a million a piece
We delayed the show for entry and so expired on the lease
Now we're gonna re-release it, t.b.d
Change the title to: Fuck You
It's what you want it to be
When you know it only pay to make nice
Pack your shit and standby, please
Your friends are trying to leave and get high

Countdown 'til you come off your rails
They said the Mission To Mars is doing pretty well
I heard it once, heard it twice, I heard everybody tell
They say the Mission To Mars is destined to sell out
Hallelujah
The iron king sings a song for the lover
The leaver, the lonely, and like
Young love waits
If I can then I'll meet you at the gate of St. Peter
When the fever takes my mind
My god she came singing my name
Sounded like rain on the mountain
While I burned alive
Young flame burns soft as a candle
Lit between our two hearts
Just beats apart in the dark

Spent my summer out and high (high)
On the whiplash
Head back blowin' through the leaves
Growin' up a preacher was all you ever dreamed

I got the holy rope
I got the holy rope
I felt the fever grip
When I needed it closer
I'm at the fever pitch
Not quite but nearin' it
Can't feed the fever yet
I'm savin' up my daily measurement

I'm at the grocery store
I'm buying eggs and toast
Lookin' at you and not where I walk
But I broke my nose just facin' god
Don't let the fever get you
Got god already
Lost my soul in the seventh heaven
Makin' out on aisle eleven

Spent my summer out and high (high)
On the whiplash
Head back blowin' through the leaves
Growing up a preacher was always just a dream
All you ever needed were lines you could believe
Sang them to me sweetly
Only just a dream

Well I know you can't walk
With them heels in the dark
Kick 'em off, let's talk
Let me get to know you
Well I don't know nothin'
But I'm quick pickin' up
And I think I could get you in a minute or two
Yeah if I could get a minute
Four, five at the limit
I think I might make you
Smile after dinner
Kick me under the table
I think that's my in
And I think I came for that
What comes with it?

Let it simmer
Let it simmer
Simmer down please

I got the holy rope
I got the holy rope
I felt the fever grip me
When I needed it most (thank the lord)
I'm at the fever pitch now
I'm at the fever pitch
Not quite but nearly there
I mean it man

Called to the Devil and the Devil did come
I said to the devil, "Devil do you like drums?
Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum?"
He said only "sundown, Sundays, Christmas"

Some day's end when I need a few friends
Now and again I could never hope to keep them
Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted
Never had they needed a good friend as I've been

Don't get me venting on friends who resent you 'cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to
They thought was a necklace and reckless they fell into hell where you both hang with nothing to do but

Scratch, kick, let gravity win like
Fuck this, let gravity win like
You could leave it all behind, even the Devil need time alone sometimes
You could let it all go, you could let it all go
It's Called: Freefall
It's Called: Freefall

Called to the Devil and the Devil said quit
Can't be bothered better handle your shit
Keep about your wits man, keep about your wits
Know yourself and who you came in with
Can I sit down I've been hustling all day
I can't even count how many souls I've made
Off the same deal you on
Remember: The Devil ain't a friend to no one
But FUN, true

You could let it all go, you could let it all go
It's Called: Freefall
It's Called: Freefall

Called to the Devil and the Devil said "Hey! Why you been calling this late? It's like 2 A.M. and the bars all close at 10 in hell, that's a rule I made"
Anyway, you say you're too busy saving everybody else to save yourself
And you don't want no help, oh well
That's the story to tell

You could let it all go, you could let it all go
It's Called: Freefall
It's Called: Freefall
You could let it all go, you could let it all go
Cause ain't shit free but falling out
And that shit's easy let me show you how, it's like...
Ain't shit free but falling out
And that shit's easy let me show you how, it's like...

Fuck, don't tell me you're fine all the time
It'll get in my head a bad way, babe
Don't let it creep in your mind, you'll go blind that way
And that's a madness that breaks faith

They say the Kingdom of Heaven touched down
In an interstate motel lobby
True to the American WAY (the American WAY)
It's available only today
Americana's crusade for the common man's promised land

Kaboom
Blowout
Everything must go
Everything must go
Make way for the Kingdom come
Blowout
Everything must go
Everything must go
Make way for the revolution

They call that Holy War in Dallas
They send crusaders to reclaim the new Jerusalem
They say the Queen was born of malice
The Queen of Babylon and all her sons ascended to the throne

They cry for Holy War in Dallas
They send crusaders out from Phoenix to Beijing
They're calling "Purify the palace, the streets"
But the temple remains unclean
Yea, the temple remains unclean

I see it said in your eyes all the time
You ain't gotta tell me you're fine babe
They call that Holy War in Dallas
They call for Holy War on us

I'm a master of Matchbox guitar sessions
You're a master of passive-aggressive magic tricks
Like, that's not a card that I would've picked but it's your life to live like how you'd like to live
You're type of cool that likes to talk a lot
I'm the type of fool to listen
They say a wise man lends his ears but not his thoughts often
The same is true of undercover cops

And the undercover bubbler got me doubly high as heaven
Were still under the radar, seven billion on the planet
Wading straight to the moon
Salutations to Apollo
While the Mission To Mars is surely soon to follow
And you bit my lip when I kissed you
I bit my tongue not to tell you that I miss you
We shared my blood for an instant and I would trade some more to have it back
Yeah I would trade all of this for that

I'm in the back of a fifteen passenger van doing an expose on feelings I don't fully understand
Started a Matchbox guitar slow jam
With hope just as large as the room in my car
My career went as far as the can that I kicked down the road for awhile until I'm just settled in
Hold it for change from charitable donors like
Excuse me sir, miss could you spare a moment to...

SUPPORT LOCAL SUPPORT LOCAL
I know I should've been more vocal
Sure, I could've been more social
I've been hanging out it's a short rope though
It's been awhile I should've wrote but I'm going postal
I'm GOING POSTAL

I ain't trying to paint you conclusions
It's pay to play rules and
Today's a day for suit and tie celebration
Nailed it hammered loose and I'm

Falling down with shit caked in my shoes
I ain't feeling this pair of 2s
Ante up or just fold boy
Take a whirl or take to
Fakin' it baby

I've been patient watching you the way move
Detecting all of your clues
Feeding off of your cues like 1 2 3 4 5
I'll get it right and play nice soon as you do

Running off again running off of gin and cigarettes
Front talking it's a cakewalk till I miss a step
Make it there take a breath and start popping a sweat
This molly got me in all my days
I've never seen a show stopper like you
Calling out the moves soon as you MAKE EM UP, JUST A TOUCH
Could make a boy act stupid
Take my delusions grind up into your bowl
Puff on that till I'm blue green serpentine
Visions snaking out of our tea
Not sure what it all means
But I could get used to seeing your cool demeanor lighting my scene up
Tripping all day til we keeping our knees up
Dripping always til our sins look cleaner
Walking down mazes in our minds to find our ways permeate
The walls in your room

Permanent as all we been through

Face in
Placate
Flake out
For miles, for mine, for I know
You could sell me on anything
Reach for the telephone or let it ring
Teach me to let it go
I think no luck nothing but us in violence
I hate fighting when I'm driving
Leave me now or leave cagey for 25 exits
Davis Coltrane white lines exchanged in silence

Service fell off in the underground
Caught the line back to your basement
Came with

Fear in my heart
Cold to the touch
Love ain't enough a drug to make us
Make us make amends
You and I, we've been friends through screens
The screens, the screen-door's coming off the rails
Come in, come in

Come off the rails
Failed to reveal appeals apparent to my soul
Call me back if you wanna talk
Long distance collecting love
Strong feelings ain't enough to break the silence holding us
Hold my phone
If you needed me then, then, then, why wouldn't you bring it up?
Then why wouldn't we be together if "all that we need is us" ain't too much as ask for?
Nah it ain't too much
Ain't too much
I hate to say that I miss you first but
Send my love send my love right away baby
All day all night I wish you would leave me
Hurting
I know us is more than we deserve but
If I may and you're awake I'll be coming home late
It'd be cool if I could stay for a minute
Baby lately I've been waiting
To feel your mood move me

I love the way you know how
I love the way you walk out
I love the way you shut it
Down
Now
Paint it MOODY ORANGE
I got some radio wires soldered to my heart
You're the only thing that's coming in
I'm getting static from my better sense
Nothing on the FM
See, I've been praying for a signal
A sign that you haven't sent
You might be an angel falling from the Heavens
Or a stranger from a garden party drunk and roaming ever since

I've got a Radio Heart and you're the only thing that's coming in
Static from my better sense
Stagnant on my betterment
I'm praying for signal or a sign that you haven't sent
Running from a place where they don't make people like me
I keep the car running
I keep my bags packed
I don't wanna leave, just don't wanna leave last
I've been praying for your touch, your glance, your hand

And he's a better kisser than you'd think, Mom
He's a better listener than most
We took pretty pictures by the sea, Mom
Fell in love and sailed off
And when the Son of Man had me in his clutches
The Son of Man had me in his clutches
The Son of Man had me in his clutches
The sons of men pulled me to the touch and I loved it

I hate you more than I miss you
That's not true, I'd hate to miss you
Anywhere I go anywhere you've been before
I get the chance to say goodbye
Or hello I mean
You don't call
You don't write
You know I've been up for forty days and forty nights and all my fears have multiplied
By the silence in your eyes

Does he stay for the way for the air you're movin
You're movin
Does he stay for the way for the air you're movin
You're losing it

Better Hide your love, Hide your love
Don't let it slip away, don't let it slip away
You better Hide your love
Hide your love
Don't let it slip away
Don't let it slip away
You better Hide your love
Say Hide your love
Now now Hide your love
Hide your love
Sugar city come home
Wizard on a weekend
Willing on a weekday
Are you kidding come on
Fed up with the prepay
Looking for a keepsake
I'm no emerald liar
Dying for a card up my sleeve
I'm the gambling kind
For higher stakes and brighter takes I'll play

I'll make a deal with you, if all you want
Is not to leave love, to run 'em up

Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
Call when you can
Call me when you're close

Sugar city
Pretty magic
Got me good vibes
Thank God I ain't driving
Traffic vision
Blurred blue bleedin'
That's a black out ladder
It don't matter anyhow
I'm climbing
Keep my good vibes
And check coats for cool climates
In common we got
Good friends rolled light on split ends
Pretty magic
Traffic addicts

Now I don't really know where you stay at, can I get an address?
Never mind my phone dead forget it
I don't really know where to bake that, less you tryna get in
In which case... my phone dead, forget it
And I never answer calls when I'm in the kitchen
Cooking
It's just a thing
It's out
And I never call back when my friends all looking at me in the car
Cause it'd be all they wanna talk about
Oh you tryna to get a deal? A deal? A deal
Sorry on the real
But my eyes and my ears don't work well
And the floor keeps sliding out my heels
I can't feel 'em am I still dreaming?
Skull on the table a still life
Is this still life?
What's the meaning are we still dealing?
Feel like I can't act right
Oh right

Sugar city
Pretty magic
Got me good vibes
Thank God I ain't driving
Traffic vision
Blurred blue bleedin'
That's a black out ladder
It don't matter anyhow
I'm climbing
Keep my good vibes
And check coats for cool climates
In common we got
Good friends rolled light on split ends
Pretty magic
Traffic addicts

I'll make a deal with you, if all you want
Is not to leave love, to run em up

Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
Call me when you can
Call me when you close

When were you planning on coming my way?
I've been here waiting all damn day to turn the the lights down low
And turn the table on you
Will you keep all that you came with and more?
I'd play your game but I don't know what for
Cut the cable on
Every table I lose

Call me When It Lands
Hit me up when you're close
When you know you've won



I've been coasting
I've been coping okay for the most part

Everybody I know wants to be a star
Just above the atmosphere flying high
Just above the average fear to try
Keeping me grounded, holding me down for miles
Everybody I know wants the gleam
In designer tops and ten dollar magazines
Infatuated with the beams, you go crazy when I speak
Aggravated when I say what I mean
I mean, I mean

You see, is that
I'm a master of Matchbox guitar sessions
You're a master of passive aggressive magic tricks
Like: that's not the card that I would've picked but it's your life to live like you'd like to live
You're the master of Matlock lock picking lessons
I'm the asshole who keeps laughing at our predicaments
Like this ain't the life that I should've picked
But it's the cards we're dealt we play with
Shit

Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
Prescription made PAiNkillers

Count your blessings early before the lot will hit the gates
Winnings for the lucky living just takes PAiNkillers

Living just comes with a bit of heartache
Heartache comes with a bit of young faith
Faith stays young till your heart get broken
Hope grows up to become someday
I never hurt no one and no one will ever hurt me
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Faith plays dumb till the doubts all leave
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Manna won't fall till the people all speak
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Canaan ain't far for the souls who barter their pain for sweet relief

My queen won't feed on milk and honey
She impartial to the summer sun
She's a lone fire burning in the sand
And a cold, lonely night without one

She cocks her pistols 'fore she pops her collar
Oh she's all but lethal pulling off that laser gun
She's rips the halos off of angels for the fun of it
If all she ever does is smile at you, run

What'd ya need these for?
Round here the cries die young
Fly momma, fly to where you come
Speak momma, round here the quiet die young

Very lovely morning
Don't kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
And don't you ever pay mind to that line in your way that says you'll ruin it
You'll ruin this for everybody won't you

Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all the things you'll be missing
Prescription made PAiNkillers
You're caps on some letters the Devil won't recognize
You emphasize politeness
Policy got to me battered but hard to beat heart beating
And I'm deaf and I'm dumb and I'm numb
But I empathize to reconcile and save time
Screaming your feeling repeating your needs
I can read when you seethe
I repeat: I know grief when I see it
Believe me, I know
Creature fear creeping up seeking the weak in us
Quit picking meat from us wolf in the sheep in us
Preaching it justice
Preaching adjustment
I should just shut up and cut the
Goddamn lights off
It's too late to turn back now
Trust me there's a few ways to renew faith
It's too late to earn those all (just)
Grab all
Grab all you came for
To rectify your nature to homeostasis
You're making a scene
You're making a scene baby
To wreck the scene
To Recktify us
You're making a scene
You're making a scene baby
To wreck the scene
To wreck the scene
To rekt

I feel like a cat pulling strings
Think I unraveled my mind
I dropped a mouse into the sink just to watch it climb out
Then took it to the woods and said you're free
You'll be living like this for awhile now
You're free
For awhile now at least

You say Cupid, I say Comet
You say Wallace, I say Gromit
You brought it back when I said
You promised to just call the whole thing off, please
You stay needy, I stay friendless
You stay pristine, I stay pretentious
We'd get married but it's too expensive
Let's call the whole thing off, please
OH. MY. GOD
This ain't a happening to me
And it's ALL. YOUR. FAULT
Said by popular decree
Possum Queen by law, she's been building up estates in East L.A

Is this your first time? That's sweet
Say "hello" to looking-forward for me
If I could set your mind at ease
This will last forever
And when it doesn't, love it for what it is
Don't miss it the way I do
The way I used to
If you love it, love it for what it's been
Don't miss it
Don't wish it back
Don't wish it'd last 'cause if it doesn't
Love it for what it is
Don't miss it the way I do
Don't miss it
Don't miss it the way I miss you

She's the edge between the sacred and profane
And means at least one other language you would never speak in Polite Company
She's a dancer, lone riddle in the answer
She auditioned for Romantics
But no calls from the right company

She'll never love the way you need her to, darlin'
You'll never lift her at all
She only wants the man she thinks is you, darlin'
You'll only take her if you think you could lose
So what if I don't find you, take you back?
I only want what I can't have
If you love me, give me nothing
But
Polite Company

We're the dance among the drunklegs, a contest between
Untied lace, pop-shoegaze, and 808 Heartbreak
We both caught the pace of two hearts, offbeat

What will hold you when the dance is through?
Put your back against the wall
Follow syncopated water fountain conversation
Making love inside a crayon covered bathroom stall
What if I don't find you, take you there?
I only want what I can't have
If you love me, give me nothing
Nothing

Some simple math
Two I can add
I ain't writing it down
I remember now what you came for, where your aim is
Maintain it
Try to burn the right glow
I'll be on my way out
I'll be over soon
Sober later
Fire that only I'd know
You've been on my Radar
Are you lonely too?
'Cause your coast is clear to get a hold on me

She's the edge between the cadence of my name
And on these walls another language we would never speak
In Polite Company

I can't run to you, father
I need love
I can't talk to you, mother
I know it's got you caught up

But your sweet sinless sensation is not my style
And I'm not giving up

But tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?
So tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?

Colors blend
They're all black and white
Goddamn me, I can not bend
I'm all shriveled inside

But your sweet sinless sensation is not my style
And I'm not giving up

So tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?
Tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?

Ain't no point in tryna picking me up when I'm down
Yeah, you can stick out your hand
And you can lean towards the ground
I'll be tryna suckle all the liquid out the dirt
Tryna catch a curve, digging my own grave
Ooh mama
I'll be tryna suckle all the liquid out the dirt
Tryna catch a curve, digging my own grave
Ooh mama

But your sweet sinless sensation is not my style
And I'm not giving up

So tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?
Tell me if I run away
How long will I bleed?

Lover come over, look what I've done
I've been alone so long, I feel like I'm on the run
Lover come over, kick up the dust
I've got a secret starting to rust

She said, I'm looking like a bad man, smooth criminal
She said, my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said, that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, I'm just tired, she said, you're just high
And I said, I saw you in the water
And I said, I saw you in the water

Lover come hold me, heads on the fritz
Gaudy intoxicated feelings comfortably mixed
Lover come hold me, could you forget
I've got a secret, digging a ditch

She said, I'm looking like a bad man, smooth criminal
She said, my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said, that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, I'm just tired, she said, you're just high
And I said, I saw you in the water
And I said, I saw you in the water

Sweating all your sins out
Putting all your thoughts back together
Oh, we just don't blend now
All of my attempts seem to weather
Oh, I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe
Oh, I make you cringe now
Don't I make you cringe

She said, I'm looking like a bad man, smooth criminal
She said, my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said, that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, I'm just tired..

She said, I'm looking like a bad man, smooth criminal
She said, my spirit doesn't move like it did before
She said, that I don't look like me no more, no more
I said, I'm just tired, she said, you're just high
And I said, I saw you in the water
And I said, I saw you in the water (do I make you cringe)
And I said, I saw you in the water
And I said, I saw you in the water (do I make you cringe)
And I said, I saw you in the water

I can't open up to you
Me and my friends are lonely
I don't know what to do
I always figured I'd be the one to die alone

I cope smothered in smoke
Dehydrate my soul
I know things that you don't
I've met murdering folk
And they took one of our own
They took our innocent home

So I can't open up to you
Me and my friends are lonely
I don't know what to do
I always figured I'd be the one to die alone

So is there any lesson in confessing that you posted up
Like Jesus on the corner selling baggies full of blessing?
Is it stressing all the things that you have morally accepted?
Is it vexing wearing clothes that you have bled in?

Picture perfect victim, overwhelmed and so sadistic
I was looking for a purpose, what a chance you had some with you
On the street when I forgot, the city breathes when I do not
If I leave it does not stop here, no
So is there any treason in the tricky little price I pay?
Oh is there any treason in the tricky little price I pay?

I can't open up to you
Me and my friends are lonely
I don't know what to do
I always figured I'd be the one to die alone
I always figured I'd be the one to die alone
I always figured that I'd be the one to die alone


Hey Mr. Stargazer
Give me a straight razor
Don't let it all faze her
When minors gets so major

'Cause it don't stop
No, it don't end
Oh when the seams, will start to wearing thin
Oh and we'll see, if the same thing goes for them
Oh and I tried to start caring like you and like them
When you said that I was killing myself
I've killed everything but my shame

Hey Mr. Trailblazer
Spare you a joint paper
It's strange how the days layer
And weigh on you years later

'Cause it don't stop
No, it don't end
Oh when the seams will start to wearing thin
Oh and we'll see if the same thing goes for them
Oh and I tried to start caring like you and like them
When you said that I was killing myself
I've killed everything but my shame

Oh and I'll try to convince myself I'm worth it
Oh and you'll lie with your strange and fitting purpose
Oh and I'll try to convince myself I'm worth it
Oh and you'll lie with your strange and fitting purpose

Well I swore I would never go there
Oh, I've killed everything but my shame
Shame shame shame

Well I swore I would never go there
Oh, and healed everything but my shame
Shame shame shame

Hey Mr. Stargazer
Give me a straight razor
Hey Mr. Trailblazer
Spare you a joint paper
Hey Mr. Stargazer
Give me a straight razor

Darling, can't you see
I'm a broken man
With addictive tendencies
And I think I love you
But I don't ever think I can
Ever learn how to love just right
So run away from me
Run as far as your
Dark brown eyes can see
Just as soon as you know

That I don't ever think I can
Ever learn how to love you right
Oh and all the ways that you won't bend
Are the only ways I live my life

Oh and I'm trying to crawl up
And burn just right
Oh and I don't ever think I can
Ever learn how to love you right

Darling, can't you see
I'm a broken man
With addictive tendencies
And I think I love you
But I don't ever think I can
Ever learn how to love just right
So run away from me
Run as far as your
Dark brown eyes can see
Just as soon as you know

That I don't ever think I can

Oh and all the ways you won't bend
Are the only ways I live my life

Oh and I'm trying to crawl up
And burn just right
Oh and I don't ever think I can
Ever learn how to love you right

I think I'm better on my own
But I get so lost in you
I think I'm better on my own
But I'm so obsessed with you
I think I'm better on my own
But I get so lost in you
I think I'm better on my own
But I'm so obsessed with you

And I don't ever think I can
Ever learn how to love you right
Oh and all the ways you won't bend
Are the only ways I live my life

Oh and I'm trying to crawl up
And burn just right
Oh and I don't ever think I can
Ever learn how to love you right

And I don't ever think I can
Love you right
Oh, and I don't ever think I can
Ever learn how to love you right
Maybe I'll stay right here
Maybe I'll keep this mind
Maybe I'll live in this moment forever
Maybe I'll speak to you
Maybe I'll walk this line
Maybe I'll adjust to adjusting together

I could open the door and breathe in the dust
I could walk through those flames till I don't feel their touch
Oh but how can I leave when I know what's out there

Maybe I'll lie to you
Maybe I'll play this role
Maybe I'll act like my act is together
Maybe I'll cope with life without hope
Maybe I'll open the door and fall through the floor

I could open the door and breathe in the dust
I could walk through those flames till I don't feel their touch
Oh but how can I leave when I know what's out there

Maybe I could stop
Focusing on the particular
Could you help me
Stop focusing on the particular
Focusing on the particular

Hung high and dry, where no one can see
If there's no one to blame, blame it on me
Storm in the sky, fire in the street
If there's nothing but pain, put it on me

You are the cold inescapable proof
You're evil, the way in the life and the truth
You're revival, beginning and you're genocide
And I watch in wonder
You are the cold inescapable proof
You're evil, the way in the life and the truth
You're revival, beginning and you're genocide
And I watch in wonder

Hung high and dry, where no one can see
If there's no one to blame, blame it on me
Storm in the sky, fire in the street
If there's nothing but pain, put it on me

I know that you'd never feel like I do
And I'd break into pieces right in front of you
And I'd burn down the city and string up the noose
And you watch in wonder

Hung high and dry, where no one can see
If there's no one to blame, blame it on me
Storm in the sky, fire in the trees
If there's nothing but pain, put it on me

I know that you'd never feel like I do
Will break into pieces right in front of you
I will burn down the city and string up the noose
And you'll watch in wonder
Pushing past the limit
Trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger
'Cause I forgot I lit it

Ripping with my sinners
Because fuck it man, I ain't no beginner
And then I crawled back to the life that I said I wouldn't live in

'Cause I couldn't open up
I'm always shiftin
Go find yourself a man who's strong and tall and Christian

Pushing past the limit
Trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger
'Cause I forgot I lit it

Drunken in Seattle
To both ends without a paddle
I don't remember your face or your hair or your name or your smile

'Cause I just couldn't open up
I'm always shifting
Go find yourself a man who's strong and tall and Christian

Pushing past the limit
Trippin' on hallucinogenics
And then I crawled back to the life that I said I wouldn't live in

'Cause I carried on like the wayward son
And now through and through I have come undone
And now I am just but the wayward man
What with my bloodshot eyes and my shaky hands
'Cause I carried on like the wayward son
And now through and through I have come undone
And now I am just but the wayward man
What with my bloodshot eyes and my shaky hands

Pushing past the limit
Trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger
Cause I forgot I lit it

I am the man we both couldn't stand
I can't wash off the dirt from my hands
What was it like to feel in love
What was it like to feel in love
I can't scrub off the black from my lungs
I can't wipe off the taste from my tongue
What was it like to feel in love
What was it like to feel in love
I can't scrub off the black from my lungs
I can't wipe off the taste from my tongue
What was it like to feel in love
What was it like to feel in love

I will never go backwards
I will never be free
I will never run faster
When you sink down to me
I will never go backwards
I will never be seen
In the wake of disaster
Will you sink down at me

I am the house that's built upon sand
I am the thought that you couldn't plan
What was it like to feel in love
What was it like to feel in love
I'm the escape to something that's worse
I am the shadow driving the hearse
What was it like to feel in love
What was it like to feel in love
I'm the escape to something that's worse
I am the shadow driving the hearse
What was it like to feel in love
What was it like to feel

I will never go backwards
I will never be free
I will never run faster
When you sink down to me
I will never go backwards
I will never be seen
In the wake of disaster
Will you sink down at me yeah
Will you sink down at me
Will you sink down at me yeah

I will never go backwards
I will never be free
I will never run faster
When you sink down to me
I will never go backwards
I will never be seen
In the wake of disaster
Will you sink down at me

I am the house that's built upon sand
I am the thought that you couldn't plan
What was it like to feel in love
What was it like to feel in love
I'm the escape to something that's worse
I am the shadow driving the hearse
What was it like to feel in love
What was it like to feel in love

Cliffy's cutting close to the power line
But his daddy can't tell cause he's just as high
And I wanna let him know but I won't this time
Cause I'm running real low and he's my supply

Oh so just tell me, are you still hurting?
And where did you come by all of those burdens?
Oh so just tell me, are you still hurting?
And where did you come by all of those burdens?

So I rumble and I tumble with the man upstairs
He said, "Boy, you gotta stop pulling out your hair"
I'm not gonna go away, I'm still involved
"You ain't drowning me out with that alcohol"

Oh so just tell me, are you still hurting?
And where did you come by all of those burdens?
Oh so just tell me, are you still hurting?
And where did you come by all of those burdens?

Cause I bet my life on you
Oh I bet my life on you
Oh I bet my life on you
Oh I bet my life on you

Oh so just tell me, are you still hurting?
And where did you come by all of those burdens?
Oh so just tell me, are you still hurting?
And where did you come by all of those burdens?

Mama's so strong, but her body's tired
But she jumps up to hug me when I come home
And Dad hates to smoke, but he chews tobacco
And he taught me to find God on my own
And Kendal is no stranger to trouble
But her boys are gonna love that crazy soul
Oh, and Britney's still scared from after banter
But if Andrew was here, he'd be proud of her

So maybe love was always near
Maybe love needs the fear
Well maybe love is a broken thing
Maybe love needs nothing

So I chain smoke the pack in Salt Lake City
And your voice sounds the same when I'm alone
I was drunk at the wheel in Norfolk Virginia
Oh and I came to tears thinking of her
Oh and darling I know that I haven't told you
But you mean more to me than you must know
But my head's full of fear and my heart of sorrow
But when I'm patient enough, you've always said go

So maybe love was always near
Maybe love needs the fear
Well maybe love is a broken thing
Maybe love needs nothing

It's carrying you, it's carrying you
Don't let it go, I'm so far away
It's carrying you, it's carrying you
Don't let it go, I'm so far away
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared
Don't be scared

You're like the calmest slit to my neck
Bring me in closer
Spruce up my soul and you fill it with coal then you douse it in lava
Chained to my desk
Beckoning nausea
Desperately chosen from a crowd of one and I, I

Call me Mr. Rattlebone
Holy Ghost who haunts your home
They don't know you like I know you
Call me Mr. Rattlebone

That's right, "fuck all the drama"
I'll be your muse
Now take what I offer straight up the nose down the throat it's a bearable bruise on your conscious
But don't it feel good?
Don't you feel calmer
I am the way and the life in the best looking truth
Oh, oh, oh

Call me Mr. Rattlebone
Holy Ghost who haunts your home
They don't know you like I know you
Call me Mr. Rattlebone

I am the driver, I am the shadow, and I am the hearse
I am the driver, I am the shadow, and I am the hearse
I am the driver, I am the shadow, and I am the hearse
I am the driver, I am the shadow, and I am the hearse
I am the driver, I am the shadow, and I am the hearse
I am the driver, I am the shadow, and I'm in the hearse
I am the driver, I am the shadow, and I'm in the hearse
I am the driver, I am the shadow, and I am the hearse
My teeth are rottin' away
I've leathered all my skin
And my blood is getting thin
And my whole fucking character's changed

I don't know who I used to be
But it certainly isn't me
And the more and more I drink
I am afraid

That I'm just killing myself
Got me fearing for my health
I'm scared that hell is just a place on Earth
And I pray to god I leave before
Satan pours another drink

I'm just living like a man
I'm just living like a man on fire
I just don't care that much
I'm just living like a man
I'm just living like a man on fire
I just don't care that much

Combustible, confused, and free
I no longer see that coast
That I always used to see
And I think it drifted far from me

Why am I talking to a ghost
That I've never even seen
When I haven't even heard you speak?

You said the months go by so quick
Maybe you're just full of shit
You're never last, I'm sorry I just said that
Maybe life was just a bet
That I lost to drugs and cigarettes

I'm just living like a man
I'm just living like a man on fire
I just don't care that much
I'm just living like a man
I'm just living like a man on fire
I just don't care that much

In my mind
I will wander that way
Till I see
The fire escape

My teeth are rottin' away
I've leathered all my skin
And my blood is getting thin

I'm just living like a man
I'm just living like a man on fire
I just don't care that much
I'm just living like a man
I'm just living like a man on fire
I just don't care that much
My own reflection's making me sick
I've been this way since my faith quit
And I never asked for this pain, it's taking me over
It's taking me over, it's making me colder

If I broke it would you quit
Is this heartache we can fix
In the morning when we wake
When I'm sober, would you stay
If I broke it, would you quit
Is this heartache we can fix
In the morning when we wake
When I'm sober

Please just go easy on me baby
Go easy on me baby
Can you understand it
I can't keep living for the damage
Please just go easy on me baby
Go easy on me baby
Can you understand it
I can't keep living for the damage

My own deception is moving too quick
I tried to love and I lost it
And I never wanted to change, it's taking me over
It's taking me over, it's making me colder

If I broke it would you quit
Is this heartache we can fix
In the morning when we wake
When I'm sober, would you stay
If I broke it, would you quit
Is this heartache we can fix
In the morning when we wake
When I'm sober

Please just go easy on me baby
Go easy on me baby
Can you understand it
I can't keep living for the damage
Please just go easy on me baby
Go easy on me baby

Well, I come a long way from the trips and the shaky hands
If you're lookin' down on me, I could really give a good goddamn
Lotta miles, lotta folds, I'm still findin' out who am
Lotta miles, lotta folds, I'm still findin' out who am

And every time, it's my fault somehow
Now I know why you don't trust me now
Every time, it's my fault somehow

Don't you tread on me
I could hardly sleep
So I don't
And I can hardly speak
So I won't

Don't you tread on me
I could hardly sleep
So I don't
And I can hardly speak
So I won't

Well, I come a long way from the tricks and the easy road
I been stitching up my mind
I been tryin' not to hold that grudge
Lotta miles, lotta folds, I'm still tryin' to just get back up
Lotta miles, lotta folds, I'm still tryin' to just get back up

Don't you tread on me
I could hardly sleep
So I don't
And I can hardly speak
So I won't

Don't you tread on me
I could hardly sleep
So I don't
And I can hardly speak
So I won't

I'm tryin' to live in the moment
Like you told me
I'm tryin' to control it
Without givin' it up
I'm a soldier
And I'm on my feet for now
I'm gotta to live in the moment
Like you told me
I'm gotta to control it
Without givin' it up
I'm a soldier
And I'm on my feet for now

If you're lookin' down on me, I could really give a good goddamn

Don't you tread on me
I could hardly sleep
So I don't
And I can hardly speak
So I won't

Don't you tread on me
I could hardly sleep
So I don't
And I can hardly speak
So I won't (so I won't)
I saw, and I swear
An old man with a dead-lock stare
And he said to me
You're too old to be pretending

But you don't know me, I ain't got no legacy
And he said to me, it's not too late to pick up the pieces
Woo, woo
Ye-a-ah
Woo, woo

I said that I smoke
And been known to drink my share
You're young, you're drunk
He said with a stone-cold glare

But you don't know me, I ain't got no legacy
And he said to me, it's not too late to pick up the pieces
Woo, woo
Ye-a-ah
Woo, woo

You're walking in the shadows
Walking in the shadows of your fear
You're headed for the gallows
Sin around your throat is always near
So before I leave, just know
Just know
Oh, before I leave, just know
Just know
Before I leave, just know
Just know
Oh, before I leave, just know
Just know
It's not too late to pick up the pieces

Woo, woo
Ye-a-ah
Woo, woo

Oh, now leave
Well, I felt the burn
Since the day you departed and talked from the tomb
I'm still healing those wounds
And it holds me down
But made me a man that says, "Fuck all those rules
I will be who I choose"

It's a lonely road
With one grip on several psalms and one grip on the gun
And it holds the rope
It spins me in circles and dizzies my head
Then says sleep when you're dead

Were you ever here?
Or just lost on the surface that at the first touch
Just evades in the dust
And it pulled me down
And showed me my demons lined up in the secrets
Forming a crowd
It was so long
With a piece of happy home that they stripped from the bone
I did not react
I settled my grievance by crafting a mask
And I never looked back

Tell me what you know
I'm in deeper than I've ever been
I will never grow
While this anchor is chained to my feet
Tell me what you know
I'm in deeper than I've ever been
I will never grow
While this anchor is chained to my feet
Tell me what you know
I settled my grievance by crafting a mask
And I never looked-
I will never grow
I settled my grievance by crafting a mask
And I never looked-
Tell me what you know
I settled my grievance by crafting a mask
And I never looked-
I will never grow
I settled my grievance by crafting a mask
And I never looked back

Jesus, come talk to me
I am but a blind mess, I'm wild and free
I know that I need us more than I need me
One more whisky, I'm wild and free

Oh but I'm a beat down washed up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'll be damned if I let it keep me down
Oh yeah I'm a beat down washed up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'll be damned if I let it keep me down

Oh my mother Mary, come walk with me
I'm on four drugs, I'm wild and free
I know that I fell less, less I knew me
Walk me through the darkness, come walk with me

Oh 'cause I'm a beat down washed up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'll be damned if I let it keep me down
Ay, yeah
Yeah I'm a beat down washed up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'll be damned if I let it keep me down
Yeah, yeah

You know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water
Why don't you come on out?
Ay, yeah
You know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water
Why don't you come on out?
Ay, yeah

We sing a beat down washed up beggar song
And we sing it even louder when the money is gone
Because we'll be damned if I let it keep us down
Ay, yeah
Oh yeah I'm a beat down washed up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'll be damned if I let it keep me down
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water
Why don't you come on out?
Ay, yeah
You know that it's not over
It's okay to let yourself hurt
Swimming in the murky water
Why don't you come on out?

We sing a beat down washed up beggar song
And we sing it even louder when the money is gone
Because we'll be damned if I let it keep us down
Ay, yeah
Oh yeah I'm a beat down washed up son of a bitch
I got one more cigarette and all my money is spent
But I'll be damned if I let it keep me down
Do I know better than this?
You're a word that I can't forget
Though the thought rattles my brain
Will you fold, or will you remain?

If I don't get better than this
Man in my skin
If I don't get better than this
Man in my skin

If I let go, would you hold on? Would we fly?
Is it safer if we just say that we tried?
Are we laughing at the danger?
Are we dancing after death, you and I?

As the sun waits to eclipse
And the taste teases my lips
I'm too tired to wrestle with it
Will we burn, or will we repent

If I don't get better than this
Man in my skin
If I don't get better than this
Man in my skin

If I let go, would you hold on? Would we fly?
Is it safer if we just say that we tried?
Are we laughing at the danger?
Are we dancing after death, you and I?

If I let go, would you hold on? Would we fly?
Is it safer if we just say that we tried?
Are we laughing at the danger?
Are we dancing after death?

Are we laughing at the danger?
Are we dancing after death, you and I?

I found a way I could catch that feel good
Skies been turnin', fires been burnin' since '93
Wait just a moment, I can drop my values
Skies been turnin', fires been burnin' since 17

Travelling so far to get there
All just to be here again
All just to see what they saw back then

I think it's time that you call back home, son
Fires still scorching, you've been scornin'
You look abused
Did you get out all of that angry passion?
Or is it still formin'? Has it started to torture you?
Travelling so far to get there
All just to be here again
All just to see what they saw back then

Well, you could put it all on me
Yeah, you could put it all on me
Well you could put it all on me

I found a way I could catch that feel good
Skies been turnin', fires been burnin' since '93
I bank on the funeral
'Cause I learned all my lessons that way
I chipped from my heaven's sin
'Til I stole everything that I made

And this millstone is heavy as hell
And I can't see so well
And I still feel the swell
And my hands and my feet are expelled
They're dead and in hell
And again with the swell

I bank on the funeral
'Cause the truth is alive, it's okay
The salt was in other words
More flavorful in those days

And this millstone is heavy as hell
And I can't see so well
And I still feel the swell
And my hands and my feet are expelled
They're dead and in hell
And again with the swell

Only lesson learned in this cell
Better dead than in hell
Only lesson learned in this cell
Better dead than in hell
Only lesson learned in this cell
Better dead than in hell

It's been a minute since I've stepped up
Battle with my atoms that began to uncle fester
Beside myself when I see my reflection
We're all 7 minutes from heaven

7 deadly sins just to get my bread leavened
MJ tippy toes I ain't get stepped on
Little sis see my life as direction
Blood thicker than the body I reflect on

Go go gadget chest up
Now I'm feelin festive
I ain't taking no shots
Boy I got my vest on
I ain't taking no shots
Got my Sunday best on
Best believe I'm rested up
No more getting slept on
No more getting stepped on

I went from Pam An to Pan Am
Vespa to Cessna
And randumb to randamn
Studying with braintrust
Kicked back like van damme
Tell Uncle Sam to keep my ransom

Breeze in my hair man I'm all good
Found reason again man I'm all good
I danced with my demons
And stepped on their toes
Kicked the bad habits
Adidas, adios

Breeze in my hair man I'm all good
Found reason again man I'm all good
I faced all my phantoms at the opera
You know the world got ya

I value every interaction
"I promise I'll remember" that's my motto
So don't believe me when I'm shy
Cause I'm good with names like Petey Pablo

"Hey Triiiiina!"

And all that hateful talk sound like Chewbacca
I ain't star studded but I'm honest
I'm 21 you better card me
Cause I head-butt 'em like Zenedine Zidane

Well I wake up and watch my espresso settle
Realize I must express myself better I know
I know that I know

Cause 1 on the mound worth 1, 000 in the bullpen
One of your hands is worth 2 in the bushes
Up creek, no anchor but 1 in the chamber
You better spare the messenger and shoot the breeze

Breeze in my hair man I'm all good
Found reason again man I'm all good
I danced with my demons
And stepped on their toes
Kicked the bad habits
Adidas, adios

Breeze in my hair man I'm all good
Found reason again man I'm all good
I faced all my phantoms at the opera
You know the world got ya
Good vibes yeah we bout em
Started off from the bottom and we're still here
My stipends got me feelin solemn
2 weeks and $150 dollars worth

I guess I'll get a job
I guess I'll show up for my moms and my paps
Prove em that I am an average guy
And that I ain't wastin my time just

Roll up that green
Just to catch up on sleepin
We spend the whole semester
Up in the deep end I know, in the deep end I know

Small shit take my mellow
My lucky charms ain't got enough marshmallows
And when you judge by a color
Nobody knows greener meadows

I don't got much but I roll widdit
And all my good friends they roll wimme

Out of all the things I've lost
Well I miss my mind the most
Not the dog, not the girl
Not the weight of the world
But the head that played the host

Oh long the men
Don't touch my overgrowth
Don't take your jaded blade
Across my forest of...
They've let be
Ohhh
Leave me be

I've been working overtime, vacation is overdue
Swimming through the city streets
Man my mind is so polluted
Take me to that ocean view
Take me to that ocean view

I've been working overtime, vacation is overdue
Swimming through the city streets
Man my mind is so polluted
Take me to that ocean view
Take me to that ocean view

Knee-high in the ocean is when I'm feeling most alive
I set aside all of my troubles then they ride out with the tide

Take me to that ocean view
Take me to that ocean view

Tall socks and some Converse, blue Adidas pants with the stripe on the side
They're gonna say get a job first, (get your money)
And then you settle down, nice wife and some kids
But I'm trying to do it big, Maserati for my moms
Hawa'ii for the week, I make some waves under palms
Airplane mode, no texts, no calls
Create all week no stress at all
Senior year at college catch me making beats in class
Almost flunked straight out of English, I was late to the exam
I just need that air that's freshest, homie, I don't give a damn
Out in Malibu, I'll catch the winds on private land, yeah

Knee-high in the ocean is when I'm feeling most alive
I set aside all of my troubles then they ride out with the tide

Knee-high in the ocean is when I'm feeling most alive
I set aside all of my troubles then they ride out with the tide

Live got my heart on limbo
80 miles an hour with my head hanging out the window (what you want?)
I want that MJ Space Jam whip, yep, stretch that limo
Chase the moon to flirt with the stars
I swim through typhoons just to get to shore
And it's gonna sound too loud, but I'm feeling fine as long as I'm

Knee-high in the ocean is when I'm feeling most alive
I set aside all of my troubles then they ride out with the tide

Take me to that ocean view

Man, I hope this feeling lasts forever
No body's on my mind but yours
I love it when you're ruffling my feathers
But you shouldn't let me fly no more
Because then, the kind of feeling I be on
Como la avion
You got me high, love is overgrown like ivy on your home
Back when, I played my first song for you
Nowadays you hardly sing along but you
You carried my load, I taught you to dance
Every song was your song, I carried you home
You could've walked but then you wouldn't remember (I think I got home at 4 though)
We go to azulejos in the morning
For fresh prince and press French if it's storming
But, I know I'm not the tallest, but my love is enormous
The sea is deep but my soul is deeper
20, 000 leagues, so it's hard to believe him
And my hair's like a greaser, but I'm inside myself
Will I find help or meet the reaper?
Well if ebenezer can be as happy as the dickens
Then maybe I should find some apparition
Cause I'm twisted watching Hitch with my imaginary friends
Swallow smoke and watch my soul catching fire once again, go ahead
Check my karyotype
Not the type to carry O's or steal the stereotype
Just here with my creatine feelings
Was too scared to tell you

Living for the moment, living for the moment, I be living for the moment
Keep my shoulder frozen for them people holding grudges, man, it's love over hatred, that's the quotient
Living for the moment, living for the moment, I be living for the moment
Offer my condolences, the heart of my opponents, because I'm about to leave you hanging and get back into the moment

Let it ferment
All y'all chasing cheese and you're looking like some rodents
Life is a computer and distractions are our Trojan
Man, you need some anti-antihistamines, ego looking swollen
All the bullies kind of like a colon, (full of shit)
Crack under pressure like Lamar Odom when you quit
You are Trayvon and your life's so Zimmerman
Take a second, breathe, and get into it
Put your phone down, baby put your phone down
Forget about fake friends on your profile
Wear your soul now, you gotta wear your soul now
Take your cool off, now you're looking profound
Lying in the field, man, the world is my backpack
Take the human race through space on a backtrack
Pinball in Neptune and party with NASA and come home and rescue the world from disaster like

Living for the moment, living for the moment, I be living for the moment
Keep my shoulder frozen for them people holding grudges, man, it's love over hatred, that's the quotient
Living for the moment, living for the moment, I be living for the moment
Offer my condolences, the heart of my opponents, because I'm about to leave you hanging and get back into the moment

I be fake as your fingertips
Flicking switches while giving all the wrong bitches my digits
I used to run away from all the shit on our wish list
And now vanity the only thing that's keeping them busy
I swear that I'm guilty, somebody's catching me slipping
The moment never gets a mention
Wait for tomorrow at the intersection
I crashed and burned before, I've seen, it's a setup
It only took a few seconds
Got too cool, and I lost count of my blessings
This world is too cold, there ain't no sweater that's thick enough to embellish this generation of peasants
Your stress is making my setlist
I set records, so pressure
Like life couldn't get better
Like bitch I gave you my attention and you cracked from the pressure
I've seen Diablo on the rope hanging with me, and I'm still coughing up, bloody, but it don't scare me
Because sugar lips got code to talk
Coat my arms until they're warm, you're scared to love, you're scared to fall
Excuses while I stare at walls, tell you that I'm just, just

Living for the moment, living for the moment, I be living for the moment
Keep my shoulder frozen for them people holding grudges, man, it's love over hatred, that's the quotient
Living for the moment, living for the moment, I be living for the moment
Offer my condolences, the heart of my opponents, because I'm about to leave you hanging and get back into the moment

Saturday blues, despicable me
No wifi, or trash TV
Oh, father time look how you've raised me
The last hours feel like eternity
No company, just me and 12 Yuenglings
I make friends with the salt & pepper shakers & the dark ceiling
Spin cycle on repeat, my REM cycle on retreat
Six J's beneath me, my hope deceased in finding meaning...
In this night
(Why did our trolley stop?)

And shoot the shit with delivery
It's the least I could do, I'm more decent with you
Cinderellas is slippery
I got that terabyte memory, so Imma just keep it century
And let you bob your heads like Kennedy
(Hit a solo with it)

I've been changing no
I've been changing no, no, no, no, no
I can't help it, I just- I just can't help it no
I can't help it, I can't help it no, no, no, no, no
Stone cold and it gets me feeling no, no, no

Don't- Just don't think too bad of me
Don't think too bad of me
Please don't think too bad of me no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Streetlights take me home, streetlights take me home
Streetlights take me home, streetlights take me home
Streetlights take me home, streetlights take me home, Streetlights take me home

Father God take me home, father God take me home
Father God take me home, father God...
Say 20 trips around the Sun, I'm riding passenger
Jesus took the wheel when I was burning in the atmosphere
Well how am I supposed to satisfy my soul
When these satellites, they know my alibis are phony
These drugs will hurt your hippocampus
Man it's cool, at least I'm hip on campus
Cause every day is a canvas
Your symmetry is slanted
Your bigotry is a cancer
Private browsing, mischief managed, then return to candor
Mind is clouded, the old man still snoring
These cats and dogs are all they faking I ain't even know it
Upcreek, paddle stolen, a la mode, but no one hears me
Every morning ibuprofen, hellbent I'm still heaven sent see
Momma says you smell good angel, the choir sing in unison
Don't box you in, forget the angles
You a galaxy with human skin
Father God my beautician, know there ain't no true image
Ask Houston, take a look at lunar men

Well like some planes I tried blend in with the stars so
Gotta get so high that I drop all my precious cargo
Jet stream of memories and moments that I borrowed
They gon be gone tomorrow (no)

"Don't force it mister"
"No way"
"That's one thing you taught me"
"Always"

"It's funny cause... have you ever felt like when you're sad you're like... I-that's exactly what you're saying, but its just kind of like... you're like... but I-I like being sad"

"Everything has melody in it... that's the crazy thing... some sort of melody, it might be dissonant at times... but, everything has tone if it has energy"

Beach boys on the ride home
I can get there with my eyes closed
Exactly 34 minutes after I pull out your driveway
You dial my phone

Paper cover rock
Scripture cover Peter
Yeah I'm cutting off my locks
And I'm changing my demeanor

Pool days, high tops
With my blue face, ice pops
I'ma make a shoelace necklace
Yeah we whipping pop's old Lexus

And I'm skipping school days, mic drops
Eyes on summer like cyclops
Yeah we fallin' off the sidewalk
Momma wants you home before nightfall

Summer come and I ain't got a new car
Yeah I'm still getting scooped up
Call me by my first letter "aye E what's up?"
Every now and then city need a refresher

Breaking up to Sufjan
Wake up on your futon
Why you in my crewneck, wait
(I really like that shirt)

Jerry's line too long
Teenage mutant
Coming out of my shell, aye

Yeah this be that cornerpiece, cornerstone
10 piece, Corner sto'
Skinned knees, cortisone
And ex links, chromosome

Summer feet, cobblestone
Momma leave, home alone
On my feet, Chuckie T's
On my sleeve, Corazón

'99 titans
Close to my goals, yeah
Look like Kevin Dyson
When my curfew getting closer

Hand me downs
Pick me ups
Dark side
Shouts Ryan
In my hood
Call it buck

Pool days, high tops
With my blue face, ice pops
I'ma make a shoelace necklace
Yeah we whipping pop's old Lexus

And I'm skipping school days, mic drops
Eyes on summer like cyclops
Yeah we fallin' off the sidewalk
Momma wants you home before nightfall

Na na na
Na na na
Na na
Na na na

Na na na
Na na na
Na na
Na na na

You can't stand me
You legless
Might grow my hair long
Like Legolas
Yeah I'm feeling ruthless, reckless
Yeah I'm from the city where they buck and they juke in the parking lot
Yeah we tip-toe 'round the block but the neighbors still call the cops
Yeah good intention misconstrued, I ain't tryna get locked up
Gotta give back to what give you life
I'm just tryna build my block up

Venus like Otherlands
Corner like a fly trap
Yeah Midtown motherland
Mental marathons
I run mind laps

The city sing to me
Train whistle harmony with it
(Train whistle harmony...)

Momma found the matches underneath my bed
And she like "where the weed boy, where the cigarettes at?"
Nuh uh uh uh
Momma you don't understand
The block lit a fire underneath your little man

Yeah see I done grown up on boom bap
Kwik Chek, bim bop
Zaywop taught me
Tennessee could pop

Hood rock
First stone
Skip both, stay home, lay low
Say I'm closet like Draco

I borrowed shadows
That's alone
The neighborhood drew me a rainbow
I borrowed shadows
That's a loan
The neighborhood drew me a rainbow

Yeah I'm from the city where they buck and they juke in the parking lot
Yeah we tip-toe 'round the block but the neighbors still call the cops
Yeah good intention misconstrued, I ain't tryna get locked up
Gotta give back to what give you life
I'm just tryna build my block up

Butternut
Careful not to undercut
Well if you gotta be my ex
I guess I'll be your buttercup

Hairy as a coconut
Never want to open up
I think I need the summer sun
White lies stole my tan from me
Keep a tab on me, I'll run it up

Couldn't be the runner up

Take off your cover up
A full moon's got dark sides too
So do me like your bubble gum
I've seen too much for 22
Momma said don't fall in love
Unless you know what you're doing
And it's all right
It's alright right now
And it's all right

High expectations, and low ceilings
Need no vacation, that's no feelings

I ain't wanna talk about it
I'll drink a cup of coffee about it
Smoke some toffee about it
I'm lawfully valid
To speak the truth I'm awfully callous
To all of these rappers they causing a challenge
I might drop out

Hit the stage maybe rock out
No keys no keys you locked out (you locked out)
Put the neighborhood on lockdown (that's lockdown)
And the house spotless (boy its clean as hell in here)
But we still got roaches in the kitchen
Roll like a family stone
Speak with my chest like I'm Pamela Anderson
Homie you already know

I'm a heavyweight like I turn slow
Tortoise shell frames and the piff burn slow
Yeah I run game, run game got turf toe
Keep it low key (low key) like a sagging janitor
Friends circle got a small diameter
Working everyday, ain't gonna die amateur
Yeah life a bitch, 50 cent to my name but you bet I still Handler

Skeletons in my closet make a cemetery looking kinda average
I'ma bring flame to matches
Rolling stones to mosses
And a fame to average
And a tape to the cautious

Ain't the type that gonna kill folk
Momma raised better
Rather hang with my kinfolk
And save my cheddar
And it's alright, and it's alright with me
Yeah the shit alright, it's alright with me
Ain't the type that gonna kill folk
Momma raised better
Rather hang with my kinfolk
And save my cheddar
And it's alright, and it's alright with me
Yeah the shit alright, it's alright with me

And I bankrolled that rainbow, railroad my capo
Tears on my raincoat, I'ma tighten my halo
Old friends like offset, new friends like Quavo
Gibson's that day old (yessah), mess with me on the maple

Internet wave rider
Hang ten on keyboards
Surf the pipeline
Ignore the guidelines
Destroy your timeline
Keep your mind right
And leave the fine line
I'm live as Slime Time

Keep it down
Real man, let my actions be my sound
Way I walk, way I talk
Know I'm from the south
Chacos in LA
Yeah my toes out

House show yesterday really showed out
Might move to Minglewood, sell out
Younge Avenue invite the whole town
Yeah I'm talking Collierville to Orange Mound
(What's your favorite color?)

Peel like clementines
Mixed thoughts like Gotenks
Why you so lemon lime?
Tryna double cross me?
Nah you ain't Allen I
Yeah I'm poor in self-esteem but I'm fahrenheit
I'm twenty that's my paradigm
I bankrolled that rainbow
Railroad my capo
Tears on my raincoat
For my dogs that moved away
I'ma tighten my halo

Outside, outside
I ain't really been going outside
Bout time, bout time
I live like I'm alive
I tried, I tried
I can't really have no side chick
Can't keep love divided
Still tryna rewind mileage

Skywalk like Michael
I ain't gotta use the force with it
Put the sidewalk on vinyl
Ran the track like Forest did

Yeah these meddling kids and their dogs
Peddling piff through the smog
Fixed gear
Sixth sense
Dimes ten
One buck
Come up
Vibrant
Chin up
Smiling
Dem my dogs
Dem my dogs
Dem my dogs
Dem my dogs
Dem my dogs
Dem my dogs
Dem my dogs

Yeah I tag along
With vagabonds
Wearing braids like Padawan
My life in the hands of God
My palm pilot
Mind like calm riot

Want a growth spurt?
Don't stunt, don't
Shed hemoglobin
Friends in juve live slow motion
Rather get a ten piece, hit the ocean

Man keep it cool dog
Ain't got no rules dog
Momma gonna shoot y'all
You still in school dog

Molly kill molecules
Don't mind your crew dog
Hollywood holla back
Hallelujah

Seven days no work make ya weak
Meditate feel the earth at my feet
Hand me downs got me feeling pristine
Why you paying arm and leg for Supreme?

And the police killing dreams
Why they gotta pull their weapons?
I'ma see my friends soon cause all dogs go to heaven
(Look at God)

Skywalk like Michael
I ain't gotta use the force with it

Skywalk like Micheal
Do your guy walk like I do?
Lady on the sidewalk with the bible
Wonder what she on
Wonder if she smoke dope

I've been a mess these days
Think I need fixing lately
Enter the picture
I just been high with my niggas

Both of us pray
I just blaze afterwards
And that don't make us different

I see you playing the victim
I know your God don't make time when your faith has been blind for a minute
I just need something to fix it
I like my dope with some kisses

I like my soap Eucalyptus
I like my soul like the dishes
I like it cold, single digits
Breathe and I see my existence

Buckin', jookin' stuck in loop
I am Truman, I'ma nuisance
Uma, I'm in ruins now
Shoe in like Puma
I'm feeling like Gru
Cause I found that expanding my crew would improve
All my feelings
They hold me down

And I got bros
You should know we the GOAT
Definition of friendship
I like my dope with some kisses
Tell me if this shit is working I'm trying to

Skywalk like Michael

Where am I
Gonna go
When my light
Don't come on

Has my life
Been a home
Or a kite
In a storm

How you know
How you know
How you know
Where you goin
Where you from

Sweat bullets don't shoot 'em
And get locked up like a look from Medusa
Rings in the washtub
From the dirt I've been moving

Don't misconstrue it

Your favorite color Mace Windu
You're my grape soda
Cut good drug-induced
But it's better sober

Weight on my shoulder
Weight on my shoulder

Walk the walk about it
Talk the talk about it
You the top spot
Make the block hot
When you drive by my house

Take it slower
Girl take it slower

Your double helix make me double take
Let me see your punnit
Find your lane girl
Bowl 300

That what I'm talm bout
That what I'm talm bout

Where am I
Gonna go
When my light
Don't come on

Has my life
Been a home
Or a kite
In a storm

How you know
How you know
How you know
Where you goin
Where you from

Where do my spoons go
Where does the moon go
Another world where I'm in touch
Face avalanches wouldn't budge
And I'm who I want
I echolocate
For all of my fates
The old and the new
I look for mistakes
I look for you

We can take the blankets out your statements
Make a fort with them
Young like Angus with the solo, short shorts with em

Ain't into drugs (ain't into drugs)
Man it's just in the love (just in the love)

And the self-confidence
Better than the makeup
Think outside the box
Yeah you better shape up

Tryna see you when I wake up
Tryna see you when I wake up

Let the sun warm your bones
Feel the heat from the stars
Getting rolled and getting stoned
The summer was ours
The summer was ours
Why the future so much closer than it feels
On my heels aye
Wear a Jesus piece for cross appeal
What the deal, aye

Made it 'cause we had some time to kill
Stayed cause California need to chill on the real, aye

All my clothes they smell like chaparral (chaparral)
All my clothes they smell like chaparral

If I change, don't mean that I forgot myself
I still miss notches in my belt, aye
I got the world on my breath
Memory for every hair on my chest
I got my head in the clouds
Heaven forbid

Yeah I been torn up, sure enough
Rollercoaster, Zippin' Pippin'
Keep your composure, holy roller
Yeah boy you tripping

Go through the motions
Glass already broken
Life out of focus can't capture your moments

Tie some knots with my loose ends
Trade my soul for some shoe-ins
Never mind my influence it's away and below
Mississippi my ocean, Melrose my Union
There go my roots again

Why the future so much closer than it feels
On my heels aye
Wear a Jesus piece for cross appeal
What the deal, aye

Made it 'cause we had some time to kill
Stayed cause California need to chill on the real, aye

All my clothes they smell like chaparral (chaparral)
All my clothes they smell like chaparral

If I change, don't mean that I forgot myself
I still remember how it felt, aye

Yeah roll my windows down
A hundred thousand miles an hour and I'm homeward bound
Man I used to be empowered, now I'm overwhelmed
Stratify my alibis and hold myself
You gotta know yourself

Man I was seaside, vinyasa
Wear no zapatas
Jobim Sinatra, feeling frittata
Ali Ababwa, now I'm okay with nada
Did what I wanna, now I do what I gotta
Got these past lives
In the back of my mind
Tryna ride a fine line
Between you
Hoping I can bide time
Sitting from the sidelines
Oh my God - come on through

Every night I'm, new skin like a python
Spitting image of my mom, and my daddy too
Running for the pylon
I'm a ticking time bomb, tryna get my shine on
Tryna get my shine on
It's nothing new

Momma made me straight from scratch
Homemade, homegrown, homebody stay attached
Aye Gepetto, play your heavy metal and pull me back
Tryna chase your dreams, change your pace
Leaving Tennessee, for New Orleans
Need a newer heat or a bluer flame

Every night I'm, new skin like a python
Spitting image of my mom, and my daddy too
Running for the pylon
I'm a ticking time bomb, tryna get my shine on
Tryna get my shine on
It's nothing new

Would you know my name?
The freckles on my face?
I'm my own descendants
Throwing sand in the rain
Fourth of July parade
I'm in dependence

Oh my
I've been working all week
No lie
Can't sleep and I don't why
(And I don't know why)
I'm just tryin' to unwind
Just tryin' to unwind
I'm just tryin' to unwind
Just tryin' to unwind

I toss and I turn
And I crash and I burn
This passion it hurts me
When will I learn?
I think I need to cool off
I'm feelin' supernova
I think he finna blow up
I think he finna blow up
I catch wind (Catch wind)
And throw shade (Throw shade)
I shed light
And find hate (And find hate)
Yeah, lights on, my mind off
It's a bad time
Oh my, my, my, my

Oh my
I've been working all week
No lie
Can't sleep and I don't why
(And I don't know why)
I'm just tryin' to unwind
Just tryin' to unwind
I'm just tryin' to unwind
Just tryin' to unwind

Yeah, relax
Take notes, don't you relapse
Stay focused, you don't need that
And all this feedback
A bullet to my kneecap
So I'd run but I can't react
Flex my muscle memory
I can still see
Turning keys and
Burning leaf to the third degree
From the roof dive in the deep end
Overdosed and overheated
Open season on my life
Overthinking, for no reason
Make believing that I am fine
I'm good
Been a minute since I'm back in the hood
Where the block used to hold me down
Miss being misunderstood
(Miss being misunderstood, oh, no, no)

Oh my
I've been working all week
No lie
Can't sleep and I don't why
(And I don't know why)
I'm just tryin' to unwind
Just tryin' to unwind
I'm just tryin' to unwind
Just tryin' to unwind

Guess I'm alright
Haven't lashed out in such a long time
Closing my eyes helps hold my pride
Burned my hands a lil more than I'd like
Everything's fine

Guess I'm alright
Haven't lashed out in such a long time
Closing my eyes helps hold my pride
Burned my hands a lil more than I'd like
Everything's fine

Think I might die if I see my shadow one more time
Don't remind me I'm alive with lines of fire
I'm Fahrenheit
Everything's fine

Guess I've gone blind
How come you're so hard to find
5th dimension, Poltergeist
Eyes wide open every night
Everything's fine

Everything is
Outta my sight
Outta my mind

Everything is
Outta my sight
Outta my mind

Guess I'm alright
Haven't lashed out in such a long time
Closing my eyes helps hold my pride
Burned my hands a lil more than I'd like
Everything's fine

Guess I'm alright
Haven't lashed out in such a long time
Closing my eyes helps hold my pride
Burned my hands a lil more than I'd like
Everything's fine

The memories fade
Am I made to break away?
The symmetry's safe
I wanna feel the friction, grip the grain

Bluejeans, Black Cat
Who's he? How's that?
Sprint streets, Sunset
Skip beats, backtrack
Gut speaks, talk back
New phone contact
Don't leave -
How fast is godspeed?
I'll match that

Headlights, flashback
Concrete, abstract
Life is a movie
This is the soundtrack

Denim and deep cuts
Lemonade, peach fuzz
We have the rights to all the wrong reasons

Yeah, I'm speed bumping
Joyriding
Sparks flying, but I'm still part timing
All these long nights that I'm archiving
Living highlights, but I'm farsighted

Cool if I'm calloused as long as I'm balanced
Cool if I'm clouded - that's when I'm grounded

When I'm in my lows (when I'm in my)
Really in my lows (really in my)
When I'm in my oms
Really in my oms (in my oms)

You wouldn't catch me dead-set or
Banking on a best bet
Always second-guessing
Why time got his Nikes on
Runnin' so fast you gon' kill someone
And last time I checked who my friend is
Don't depend on a stimulant
And the daydreams sting like sunburn
Eighteen and ain't gettin' younger
Why time got his Nikes on
(Go)

What's the truth without someone to hear it?
What's a feelin' without someone to feel it?
What's appealin'? Sleep in on the weekend
Home solo, spinnin' on the ceilin'

And every day is the same
When the name of the game's
Break sweat to break even (yeah)
Tell fate hit the breaks
Man I'm done switchin' lanes
Just lookin' for a reason (for a reason)

Yeah, you call shotgun
And I'll sit in the back of my mind
Yeah, you prima donna
But don't kill my body high

Why time got his Nikes on
Runnin' so fast you gon' kill someone
And last time I checked who my friend is
Don't depend on a stimulant
And the daydreams sting like sunburn
Eighteen and ain't gettin' younger
Why time got his Nikes on

Blue thoughts, double knots, don't trip
Slow pitch, love notes, lunch box, yeah
High five, up top, no watch
My time off-line, unlocked, yeah

Yeah, you call shotgun
And I'll sit in the back of my mind
Yeah, you prima donna
But don't kill my body high

Why time got his Nikes on
Runnin' so fast you gon' kill someone
And last time I checked who my friend is
Don't depend on a stimulant
And the daydreams sting like sunburn
Eighteen and ain't gettin' younger
Why time got his Nikes on

I'm desperate
Life is just a dead sprint
Headed for the exit

I'm desperate
Life is just a dead sprint
Headed for the exit

I'm desperate
Life is just a dead sprint
Headed for the exit

I'm desperate
Life is just a dead sprint
Headed for the exit


(Denim and deep cuts)
Always second-guessing
(We have the rights to)

The higher the summer, the harder the fall
The wider we open, the closer the calls
I memorize your number and the creases in your palms
Memorize your number and the creases in your palms

Joyride to Lloyd Wrights
I drive you up the walls
We borrowed apartments with Harvard and Dartmouth
Ivy spread like Peter and Paul
And finally I feel like my faults don't define me at all
Finally, I feel like my faults don't define me at all (at all)
It's all because of you

Denim and deep cuts
Lemonade, peach fuzz
We had the rights to
All the wrong reasons
"Hold on, hold on, let me actually... let me hit it first, let me hit it"
"Then we can do it, yeah"

Fist full of wind in the back of the Buick
Same one that wrecked into Madison Huey's
They be like, "Aye E whatchu doin?"
Same ole same ole, tryna get thru it
Buckin' and jookin' and choppin' and screwin'
With Rob and them hoodies and all of my color-ways muted
I'm neutral it's truthful that I've been secluded
Been dancing with demons
If seeings believing I think I'm diluted
I mean dilated
I mean belated
Man I didn't proof this
I practice aloofness
Been cuttin' the cord
'Cause I had a few Brutuses
Yeah y'all know who this is
Pardon my hubris
Aimin' for buddhist
Aimin' for...

South in my mouth and man I can't control it
Even if I hold my breath

If I hold my breath
I might not let go
Might not let go
(Yeah I might not let go)
Think I need a second wind
I think I need a second wind
(I'm on my own)

Don't call it a comeback
I call it a second wind (it's a second wind)
Good to be back in my element
'Membered I'm still doing this for the hell of it
Dap me up (dap me up)
Snap me up (snap me up)
Take a negative and develop it (okay)
Took a lil' minute just to settle in
While everybody tryna stay relevant
Back it up (back it up)
That's enough

Cause I
Feel my ego like venom
This is a moment
This is momentum

This is a omen?
Ok duly noted
I ghost ride the whip (damn)
You would think it was stolen (ghost ride the whip?)
The south in my mouth
And I cannot control it (aye)

Aye mane no I can't control it
I'm either frozen in stone or I'm floatin (yeah)
Lately been posted up in my emotions (posted up in my emotions)

Yeah it can be a lot sometimes (it can be a lot sometimes)
Tend to get lost sometimes (tend to get lost sometimes)
Tryna get outta my mind (my mind)
Gotta get outta my mind (get outta my)

Once again
I'm Memphis 10
Skin and bones
Run in circles
So Daytona
Rollin' slow
Confident head to toe
No limits
If I want
Go get it
Now you know
If I want
If I want
Go get it

Even if I hold my breath

If I hold my breath
I might not let go
Might not let go
(Yeah I might not let go)
Think I need a second wind

Once again
I'm Memphis 10 (okay)
I'm Memphis 10 (okay)
Rollin' slow (what else?)
I'm Memphis 10 (uh)
No limits
Memphis 10 (yeah)
Go get it
Now you know (now you know)

Chances are I'll miss my chances
And cannonball off my advances
Kindled or candid, I'm falling apart
I lose all of my mind when I see your car outside
Sunlit and silent - this ultra violence
It's a matter of time before we become timeless
Remind me again that I cannot rewind this
Those days aren't behind they define us

I'm a sucker for sunsets
And a lot of things that don't make sense
Like my feelings for you, offset (offset)
Something I can no longer resist
I don't want to be this sensitive
Should I sabotage?
Painting pictures I will not live in
Makes me want to cannonball

(One life, I might)
Makes me wanna cannonball
(One life, On sight)
(One life, one life)

Seasons seem to change
But my feelings stay the same
Oh, am I the one to blame?
'Cause if I am admit it
Now I'm falling for you

Falling for you
Falling for you
Falling for you

"You ready?"

One life
I might
On sight
Know you
One life
One life
One life
Won't lie to you

One life
I might
On sight
Know you
One life
One life
One life
Won't lie to you

You take me back to
Sleeping in past noon
Love on the weekends
Almost's and had-to's
We're face to face
But theres acres of space

Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap

A fresh start's all I need as I'm gargling bleach
Will this get my chakras all clean?
Hope so, soap, soap, my love could use a lather
Morals mixed with mud need a scrub
Blow away my bones with a bath bomb
Sentence me to sop in the suds
Feel like I need to shower for eternity
Society so dirty, someone get me clean internally
Wash me in detergent 'til it's burning me
Water boilin', joining her in serving me the third degree
She's right, I mean, I'm surely better than her last man
Probably better than her next man too
But these taunting tainted tracks I've marched,
Left the bottoms of my feet so black like tar

Tar in my lungs, soap
Tar in my lungs, soap
Soap, soap
Soap, C'mon, soap

I guess that I regret what I said now I'm sober
(Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap)
Do they have Head and Shoulders for inside your head and your soul or
(Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap)
Do I need a cleanse that'll foam up?
Anything to end this aroma
'Cause it smell foul from the language
Scrub me from the inside out like you're painting
Scrub me from the inside out
Brush me from the inside out

I feel stained from the smoke
Think my brain need a bathtub
Think my veins need to soak
Lemme drain all the bad blood
Let these bars clean (no soap)
Let your heart bleed (no thanks)
Secrets haunt me (no ghost)
Lemme come clean (no chance)
We stay out late
But when we fill up, we don't fill up like a gas tank
We fill up like an ashtray
She's real and blunt, she cut up me up
Feel like she spilled my guts on the park bench
Pardon me darlin', I guess I left that part of me
Sparta imparted in the Garden State, still charming
But darkened is being hardened involved in evolving Darwin
Spark restart it, get this soap by the carton
Just for all you starving artists, eat this soap by the carton
Just for all you starving-

I guess that I regret what I said now I'm sober
(Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap)
Do they have Head and Shoulders for inside your head and your soul or

Do I need a cleanse that'll foam up?
Anything to end this aroma
'Cause it smell foul from the language
Scrub me from the inside out like you're painting

I got a sweet tooth, it's been tinglin'
It tell me things and I've been listenin'
It tell me "bite down"
She look like the bell of the ball in a nightgown

I got a sweet tooth, dime pieces who this silver tongue speak to
Canine like my minds' third eye and you're see through
Baby, I see you, this Sweet tooth gon' have me flossin'
Scrub it squeaky clean til I'm nauseous
See, success is sweet but be cautious
If you gon' bite down better chomp it
She think, I'm bitter, I think, I bit her lip too hard
I think, I'm pushin' it too far, I think, we're gonna need post cards

'Cause I got cravings, candy coated lacs
Get me cakin' maybe blow a stack on vacation
No clue what I'm finna, this feeling's so new, let it simmer
Skrrt pull UP top down, I'm flyin' south for the winter
Hear Miami's warm year round, rain in Maui smell so sweet
I be on my Love Lockdown, I see you pout ballerina
Me and Lady Luck eat out, Pearly White teeth
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Metal Fantasy
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sweet, sugar, sugar, sugar, dolce

You taste like sour apple, which taste like midnight
You taste like power hour, this tastes like its right
You taste like white wine, you taste like I'm fine
You taste even sweeter than I thought
You taste like all I want
This Taste may have tainted my mind
You're the first thing, that I tasted since I burnt my tongue
Sugar, I know you, don't front, corrode the gold fronts
Sugar, I know you, don't trust, don't show love
I got a lot on my plate, but I left room for what I crave
I been starving way too long

I been waiting patiently, reservation save a seat
Now it's time to check me in, slide a benji to the maître d'
I been waiting patiently, reservation save a seat
Think, it's time to check me in
Get my shine and then something to eat

I got a sweet tooth, it's been tinglin'
It tell me things and I've been listenin'
It tell me "bite down"
She look like the bell of the ball in a nightgown

Don't know what its like but I need it right now

Sweet tooth, fangs, ite down babe
Can't Keep you tame, won't leave you sane
Sweet tooth, fangs, ite down babe
Can't Keep you tame, won't leave you sane
Sweet tooth, fangs, ite down babe
Can't Keep you tame, won't leave you sane
Sweet tooth, fangs, ite down babe
Can't Keep you tame, won't leave you sane
Sweet tooth, fangs, ite down babe
Can't Keep you tame, won't leave you sane

You're so far, are you hearing me
Teach all, all your fears to me
How much do you think, you really need to know
Before you know
Will you leave me with anything that's meaningful
Before you go
You set the trap, snare
I don't really let 'em in like that
Didn't know you could fight back, fair
Sleeping with one eye open
Always be aware
You'd ask me to share
I told you, that was rare
But you waited up all night for me,
I thought, you might just be a body running scared
Felt you guiding me, you looked into my eyes at least
Misconstrued the stare, paid the finders fee

Feeling you drawing me in
Wanna know all the ins & the outs don'tcha
I crawl to you we begin, still sleepin' with one eye open

Boxed in, sneak out, creep down the stairs to me
Caved in, dig out, fall deep, fox hole, fox hole, fox hole

You're too close
Did you know, where that step would lead
Its your fault, but it's still might be the death of me
See, you and I dug holes, mine was to be left alone
I let you in real slow, 'cause you said, you wanna know
Nothing went un-shown, then you went and filled it up with snow
I was standing on my own, but I fell into you so fast
You looked into my past
Knew, I talk during movies and you didn't mind you'd laugh
Noticed I never nap with both eyes closed
Told you most I know, bad, grab ahold my soul back
Sharp lil shortie like bayonets
Tongue on her cut like guillotines
Car from a time where they played cassettes
Aux cord she strangled me
Played with me, made me make believe
But that blade made me see
How quickly one can leave

Locked myself in with no lookout
Somehow you saw me
Can't tell its a trap when you look down
That's how you fall deep

Boxed in, sneak out, creep down the stairs to me
Caved in, dig out, fall deep, fox hole, fox hole, fox hole

They them on the road boys
They done made they own noise
We got love for nobody
We gon leave you no choice, say it back now
They them on the road boys
They done made they own noise
We got love for nobody
We gon leave you no choice
They them on the road boys
They done made they own noise
We got love for nobody
We gon leave you no choice
Search light, try to find me
Spot light, get behind me
Ain't they, ain't they, ain't they
They terrified of what I'm hiding
Cause I got terabytes filled with lighting
Blow it up, blow it up
You think you know us, I think you wrong
You think you showin' up, but took too long, blow it up
You wanna blow up spots
That's what I'll put you on

Watch who you talk bout
Word of mouth travels far now
I rocked crowds
Switched my kicks up got the rocks out
Lock down you only see me when my top down
Keep your lips sealed
Yada Yada, big deal, shh

I walk alone on these streets at night
My brim is low and my jeans are tight
Even with all you stole you still can't get the feeling right
It's so hard for me to be surprised
Y'all either do too much or not enough at all
I'm fuckin done with every one of y'all
You just front like you tryna show me love
Hold your tongue, blow it up
If they say you got juice I'm saying no you don't
If there's breath inside my lungs I'm saying told you so
If they say you got juice I'm saying no you don't
If there's breath inside my lungs I'm saying told you so

Ohho, I bet you wish you knew
I keep more friends than just who's fitting in the coupe
Ohho, watch who you talkin' to
This was not a random rendezvous

Watch who you talk bout
Word of mouth travels far now
I rocked crowds
Switched my kicks up got the rocks out
Lock down you only see me when my top down
Keep your lips sealed
Yada Yada, big deal, shh

(You need to)
Talk to me nice
I think you're confusing stars with streetlights
I think you're wishin upon something I'm not up on there's something I've been stuck on

Why don't you tell me bout the light in the distance
And how it covers the whole city while it's spinnin'
Come sing me stories like the one about the stormy seas
Or when you traveled from the south of France to Normandy

Mamacita take a seat I ordered Lagunitas
Driver's seat I take her home so she can kick her feet up
Free lanes on this freeway no autobahn
Seascapes she traveled on D Days it's high stakes my

Eyes ache from the high beams
So many fish in the high seas, she's a Pisces

Cast my line now they're biting
Rocky coasts and light houses
Swore she knows now I doubt it

Talk to me nice I think you're confusing stars with streetlights
Talk to me nice, talk me to sleep this drive has me weak top down sail
On on these high high seas
She talk to me sweet, but talks not always cheap

She's a Pisces, surrounded by these Gemini eyes I see, not just sparks but lightning

She don't know, where she plans to go,
She's no hand to hold, I lit her days but she's afraid to look
That far down as she scans the road, tryna span the globe

I always knew that attitude could sink my ship and my crew
On open ocean constellations could look clearer to you
Highway hypnosis light leaked through,
You steeped in me hot tea think I seeped into you,
Peaked new horizons I peaked into view,

You need to
Talk to me nice
You treat your friends like you don't know that they're your vice
Your stories end you're too on edge to take advice
Fight for respect, you're too defensive spend the night

Eyes ache from the high beams so many fish in the high seas, she's a PISCES, cast my line now they're biting
Rocky coasts and light houses, swore she knows now I doubt it
"Powerlines"

Flower eyes, power lines follow'n your energy
Let's see, where you lead
Lashes like petals stack us all together
Blown away in a dandelion breeze
Flower eyes paralyzed by your gaze and currents currently
Electricity
Flower eyes chlorophyll filled, stoned still emerald green
Shocking still to see

Walk me through the meadow
Flower eyes, power lines
Walk me through the meadow
Walk me through the meadow
Flower eyes, power lines
Walk me through the meadow

Flower eyes, I'll survive, I'll be fine
You know, my roots are deep
Isn't that why you chose me
Strike me like a lightning bug landing on a leaf plant it all with me
Flower eyes paralyzed by your gaze and currents still electricity
Lashes like petals act like water color
It's on paper if you bleed

Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus

Flower eyes, power lines
Follow'd your energy
Just to see where it would lead
Flower eyes, iI can feel my heart beat swift in speed
You did this for me, you knew, what I'd need
Hey, flower eyes, how can I pass this energy
Like oxygen from trees, baby, I'll make you breathe
Flower eyes, flower eyes, flower eyes, flower eyes
Flower eyes, power lines, flower eyes, power lines
Follow me
You seem lost
Which looks different than someone who is wandering
Feel like I've seen it all at least once
Been on this world before
This is not me getting on, this is just me getting on again

I learned some things bout lettin' go
I learned to swing the metronome
I'll tell ya time is not money
I know, so much it's getting old
I learned you gotta stretch to grow
I heard you talk the rest is show
Can't tell you all they jocked from me
I turn around invent some more
I turned 19, I turned the page
I left the stage, I left my home
Nobody prayed to God for me
I heard the call just checked my phone

I'm old, I'm not new to this
Young, I keep 'em glued to this
Broke, but I'll be stupid rich
Broke, but I'll be stupid rich

I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich

I'm old in my soul, young like I'm royalish
Broken like bones but rich like the soil is
My how I've grown, watch me, I'm minding my tone
You lost me I'm finding my zone, I did this all on my own

There there sweetheart, I know times seem hard
We're very close, but like old leaning trees we know
That light beats dark
I left pages of your journal in my dorm room drawers
I learned I can't draw solace from ink stained parchment no more, I
Got sick of sleepin' on floors
I gotta go get my own I'm sick of borrowing yours, I

Young, but I'm tired, I feel old, 'cause I know more
I'ma get this dough, what you think I just went broke for?
People that I know, think they know themselves they're so sure
22 years old with a life they'd sell they souls for
Got it on my own, cracked the code
Stayin' on my toes, like I'm stationed in the zone
Can't pick up my phone, only distant 'cause I'm close
You'll have what it takes when you've given it the most
Kept goin', failed, fell hard
Know how I'm put together, 'cause I picked myself apart
(I'm old, I'm old, I'm old)

(There there sweetheart)
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
(I know times seem hard)
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
(We're very close)
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
(But like old leaning trees we know)
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
(That light beats dark)

I'm old in my soul, young like I'm royalish
Broken like bones but rich like the soil is
My how I've grown, watch me, I'm minding my tone
You lost me I'm finding my zone, I did this all on my own


¡Ay Caramba! I been comin' up
¡Ay Caramba! I been comin' up (Comin' up)
¡Ay Caramba! I been comin' up
¡Ay Caramba! I been comin' up (Comin' up)

Veni, vidi, vici, I am my own fuckin' species
I love YG and the Bee Gees, I'm not fighting, I'm not feeding, huh
I'm just feeling, huh
Cast my line, now I'm reeling, huh
Noses bleeding from the seating, huh, it's quite revealing
You'd have better luck sneaking in from the ceiling, huh
They been sleeping, feel like CM Punk
I wake up to 88 new texts, okay, okay, take a breath
Deep breathing to my treasure chest
Gang deeper than a leather vest
Biker with no rider, view from Heaven's nest
Backstage so it ain't it too loud, posture proud in the present tense

She can tell by my posture
I'm no imposter
She can tell by my posture
I'm no imposter
She can tell by my posture
I'm no imposter
She can tell by my posture
I'm no imposter

You can lead a horse to water
But you can't make it drink
You can lead the sheep to knowledge
But you can't make him think
You can lead a race the whole time
And lose in the last steps
You're telling me that you can't see that we the best
She don't question me, I'm Lebanese
Is it the color of your skin or the culture underneath
Cold desert I might freeze, bold blessings in the breeze
Soul speech my expertise, South Beach for many weeks
Could not phase me or change me, my babe, uh
Salty leaf lemonade, don't tweak from the taste
I am one with the force and the force is

One with me, yeah
Said I'm one with the force and the force is one with me
(I am one with the force and the force is one with me)

Tension in the air feels like smoke in my lungs
Exhale, my head in your hands like lightning on sand
Inhale, singin' to you feels like glass in my gums
Deep breath on the track that I run
Deep stress, feel relaxed when I'm done
Deep step into the blackhole, son
Deep depths 'cause I aim like I stand
Deep texts from a girl who might jump
Keep texts like that on my phone
Just to show myself I'm not all that young
Keep going 'cause I might get it all
Keep knowing like a psychic's involved
Keep Rima Lara Nora straight
Keep my posture proper but I bet it's different when it's your estate
Keep it safe inside your castle
I knew my vision since I threw my tassels
Keep myself to myself, keep my songs off the shelf
Keep my wisdom and health, keep my thinking intact
Keep the wind at my back, keep all you found, not just wealth
Keep on keepin' on but peakin' season's all that's on their mind
I keep tryin' but haven't even scratched what's mine

She talk to me, gave me her name and numba
¡Ay Caramba! Guess this is the come up
Kept tryna hit your line
Kept tryna get it right
Kept tryna make you mine
I finally made you mine

Nosebleed
Be careful at heights like these
Your red lipstick met the blood smeared on my cheek
You kiss just like you speak

(Waiting, wade in)
It's a waste if you're just waist deep
(Sacred, patient)
Unafraid, it's okay, just be
Did you mean to say hi to me?
Know its rude but I might just leave
Don't you want to wave bye at least?
Let's find out what these finders keep
Call a ride, I'm too high, I can't find my keys
It's quite alright, we're right on time, baby
Set in stone, sittin' stoned, watch it burn slow
This poison apple toppled from the top tier of the tree
Landed right next to me
Glistened red like wet stones in the stream
Bones underneath, or your nose when it bleeds

Nosebleed
Be careful at heights like these
Your red lipstick met the blood smeared on my cheek
You kiss just like you speak

You kiss just like you speak
You love just like you eat
Too much, then not for weeks
You kiss just like you speak
You sniff, you cry, you peak
Your hype, your type, I know too well
My time is finders keep
My kind is kinda deep
My sights are high and steep
My prices aren't cheap
You might not want to need
But the kind you try to keep

I hope those deeds were good enough
I hope those seeds were good enough
I hope those deeds were good enough
I hope those seeds were good enough
I hope you get to see the reaper come
I hope we keep what we become
I hope nosebleeds don't keep you from
Looking down and keeping up

Nosebleed
Be careful at heights like these
Your red lipstick met the blood smeared on my cheek
You kiss just like you speak

Let's find out what these finders keep
Let's find out what these finders keep
Let's find out what these finders keep

Spiderweb of red in the snow
Keep getting down instead of getting over
Spiderweb of red in the snow
Keep getting found instead of getting old

I get the thrill OD
From you gambling on me
See I'd put my own cash up
If I thought it'd all add up
You became my loan shark
All this love I owe ya
Nothing for me
Just enough to owe ya
Oh, did this one just for me
And so, yeah, this hand is just for me
So now, this hand is just for me
So now, this hand's for me
I'll hold you d-

(Ooh)

You became my loan shark
Just enough to owe ya
Never gave me

This hand is just for me
Down for me
And now
Lay down a pound for me
A pound of flesh
Keep that, the rest for me

I get the thrill OD
From you gambling on me
See I'd put my own cash up
If I thought it'd all add up
You became my loan shark
All this love-

Fix up your buttoning
Look at you with your button up
You got the drugs for me

Put em on the table slow
Make sure your hands showing
You know me though
I'm real trustworthy

So now, lay down a pound for me
And now, this hand (end) is you and me
Okay let's play it out
See who the company gets underneath
This hand (end) is just for me

I'm out at sea, no reciprocation
You take your love notes like c-notes, with interest, baby
Down in the deep it's not wavy
Full boat in a place where no ship could take me

Loan shark, all this love I owe ya
Loaned me some love just as I was about to fold yeah

I get the thrill OD
From you gambling on me
See I'd put my own cash up
If I thought it'd all add up
You became my loan shark
All this love I owe ya
Loaned me some love just as I was about to fold yeah
When I got up I was under the weight of the sea, yeah
Swimming with you doesn't leave me with much room to breathe, yeah

From where I'm sat
I'll earn some diamond rings and plaques
For when I'm sad
I turn my head and I cling to that
Bet it comes right back what I would have had
If I never gave any to you
Who'da known I was full the whole time like the moon (Ooh)

From where I'm sat
The moon looks likes dew in the grass
But your eyes are huge, can you tell if I'm doing bad?
Mother Earth, I been burnin' all this gas
Swipin' this plastic and driving too fast
Flying so probably buyin' in excess
But been paper baggin' and totin' no less
Brought me up to the stars, it was worth it we figured, but baby
What's a deep breath if the air isn't fresh?

Gotta clear it why you always so mysterious
I moved fast and you were furious
I was Mia, you were Brian, ain't a cop but you were lyin'
I was massive, you were giant
All the other lights were silent
Only two left in the sky we starting intertwining, spinning
Black hole tunnel vision, but from where I'm sitting now
Helping out light the sky up
Seems like my only way up
Helping out is only what's right

Baby you were up all night
Swipin' this plastic and driving too fast
Flying so probably buyin' in excess
But paper baggin' and toting no less

Your body carbon but not copied
Your body cosmically corralled me
Like gravity you keep on working on me
Like gravity you keep on working on me

From where I'm sat
Turning the wheel to come back
Feeling my tires all shaking in need of alignment and changing my brakes but I'll make it
Barely breathing you might wanna save it
Sitting where you stood
Before you turned the pages in our book
The shade dissipated, now I'm waiting here to cook
The waste we created need a way to make it good
Your face emaciated I would feed you if I could

All of the space we don't leave
Filled with the things we don't need
All that we built, all of the land that we filled
Swallowed this planets like pills

Baby you were up all night
Swipin' this plastic and driving too fast
Flying so probably buyin' in excess
But paper baggin' and toting no less

Your body carbon but not copied
Your body cosmically corralled me
Like gravity you keep on working on me
Like gravity you keep on working on me
Like helium, lightheaded delirium
Like packs and pounds, you keep on breaking me down
You wouldn't be here alone
It's late at night and you're far from home

You know what you remind
Me of- me of- (me of)
New York in the summer time
Cause I know you're cold for the rest of the year, yeah

You come with that drama
I know your momma watched all those Spanish soap operas
Where else could you've got it
Your family tree don't have many leaves upon it
So not from your poppa

Rollie on my wrist Issa bus down
We thought we could fit but we're stuck now
Thought we were snug now we're snuffed out
We Squeezed into it, the blood rush now

It always rains when I leave New York
I left you mine and you gave me yours
Problems and answers and pain of course
I gave you space and it made it worse
Out on the stairs where you made a case
Same spot we got locked out and the locksmith got in with a credit card and we still had to pay
Right there I had just to say

I don't want to fight for your tough love
You know me I want that good stuff
I wanna see director cuts
I'll sit and watch all the extras

You wouldn't be here alone
Every breath they connect in the ozone
Every text that they sent when you almost
Took a step that was too big and too close

I wouldn't be here alone
But I'm still always alone
Nothing seems real on my phone
When you planted me did you know
You wouldn't be there as I grow

I don't wanna fight for your tough love
You know me I want that good stuff

I feel guilty
I shoulda seen you were filthy
I shoulda known you were wilting
I coulda seen the ground tilting
Don't touch me first
You'll get what you deserve
I shouldn't feed every seedling
I know I'm not always there when they need me

You wouldn't be here alone
You know you got me
You know you got me
You know you got me
Bad
You know you got me
You know you got me
You know you got me
Bad

Stuck in the south
Hook in my mouth
Could be my only chance
I took your advice, then
Had all my sights set
The signs were all we had
I was off like a rocket
You got me talking
Now you got me coming back
I started descending
I love happy endings
But nobody saw me crash
Saw a glimmer of hope
Attached to a rope but
You didn't pull me up
Now I'm all tied up
With you at my side just
Cause you wanna fall in love

We fell way down
Now it's too tuff to climb out
We fell way down
Too high to get away now
And there's only one escape route

So you know you got me
You know you got me
You know you got me
Bad
You know you got me
You know you got me
You know you got me
Bad

I don't think there's a search team
Deeper than it first seemed
We met at thirteen yeah
My phone wasn't working
My friends would intervene
We're way past the surface dang
If you really get me
You'd surely set me free
Now that's not up to you or me
So who could come to our rescue now

We fell way down
Now it's too tuff to climb out
We fell way down
Can't seem to get away now
And there's only one escape route

It's only ever deeper
Hit my Twitter and my beeper and my cell
It's like I never hear from no one else
Only ever deeper
I'm a dealer and a tweaker and it sells still
Couldn't buy my way out of this hell
Next thing I know rappel
Deep into bed now our legs parallel
You smile as I cry farewell
You know you got me under your Spell

So you know you got me
You know you got me
You know you got me
Bad
You know you got me
You know you got me
You know you got me
Bad

Darlin I can tell
Your hands were delicate the way they held
The mango as you sliced back the skin
To reveal food

And darlin I can tell
Your hands were delicate the way they held
The bottle as you poured it over ice
I was smart and you were nice

And Darlin I can tell
Your hands were delicate the way they held
The mango as you peeled back the skin
To reveal food

And darlin I can tell
Your hands were delicate the way they held
The bottle as you poured it over ice
I was smart and you were nice

(Ooh)

Smiles come a dime a dozen
But only when money's worth something
Priceless if in times of struggling
What're we spending when the worlds ending
You look like you've spent time inside
You must have a great place to hide
I been out there there's not a safe place in sight
I haven't even seen fruit that's ripe
Thought it was over til you changed my mind
Knew you were down when you found out my sign
And since then the jobs just been keeping you alive
And since then these jaws spoiled taking sweeter bites
And since then these claws manicured not coated in blood and dirt, ate a salad as an Armageddon happened outside
And Darlin I could tell
You were all by yourself
I made it look like I was tryna help
You took the private stock right off the shelf and popped it for me
Conmen only drink to celebrate a job well done And obviously this was not was for me

As far as I can tell I think you're growing on me
With
Hands that hold like ivy on walls so close I don't wanna leave
This went from a want to a need
The truth and the dares now they're weaved
You've stolen time from a thief, rolled up my cuffs
Got me clean and washed out the tricks from my sleeve
I been so drained I don't want to deceive

Cause if we're the only ones left it's our duty to
Cause if we're the only ones left it's our duty to breathe
Breathe

Adventure team
Have we seen it all before?
Feels like we've seen everything
And still you're telling me there's more

Remember when I won the grand prize
Grand in my hand, hyped up
On our way home, but the brakes had to slide
A little too close, second crash in two nights
From the side of the road had to watch the sun rise up
Had the Hyundai totalled
Just the night before, I was driving home
From the studio when I checked my phone
75 into the wall and I can still smell the airbags
Now the Chevy's totalled
Had to cop the Saab
Had to drop the top
Used to drive a lot
Now the city's subways got us hot
Or the Uber drop us off
Ain't no offer got us on
I could not stay local
It's not the weather, not the pressure
I'm too textured, architecture abroad
Seemed to broaden my sights
See the distance seemed far but
Since she told me 'bout the light

Adventure team
Have seen it all before?
Feels like we've seen everything
And still you're telling me there's more

Sometimes she feel like Calypso
Sometimes I feel like he gypped you
Sometimes I feel like my chipped tooth
Sometimes I can't believe my eyes
Went to Texas on a high
In the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night
Left Malibu surprised
Right coast boys seeing left coast skies
So peroxide swing and tiptoe sing and
Elbow nudge but hold no grudge
Anytime I leave
Cause we just gonna venture off
And take applause, hopefully take a pause
To notice all these things

Adventure team
Have seen it all before?
Feels like we've seen everything
And still you're telling me there's more

We're clear for take off
(It's always nitetime in Atlanta)

(It's always nitetime in Atlanta)
Get some sleep while you can
I need you well-rested for these things I got planned
(Never thought I'd see your face)
Gettin' bands and didn't take the advance
Moved an elbow in Atlanta just by shaking some hands
(This far away from home)

It's always nitetime in Atlanta
And I'm always awake
Never thought I'd see your face
This far away from home
It's always nitetime in Atlanta
And I'm always awake
Never thought I'd see your face
This far away from home

Know you haven't slept
Heard you haven't ate
Once you catch your breath
Come and grab a plate
Served it family style
Ate like a buffet
Midnites in the middle of the day
Open it up
Open it up
Open it up
Open it up

(I been up for four days)
(Life hasn't been normal)
(Growing up and inward)
(Talk to me without words)
(I been up for four days)
(I could use a shower)
(Giving out my power)
(I'm done giving out my power)

I am in a portal
Life hasn't been normal
Growing up and inward
Talk to me without words
I been up for four days
I could use a shower
Giving out my power
I'm done giving out my power
My DNA, all over all of the things that you say
I figured I had been feeding you good
So good I'm watchin' you regurgitate
Now I need that energy back in the bank
Happy I watered your flora and fauna
I fed you the bread and you opened the bottle
The seeds that you plant today blossom tomorrow
I'm hummin' my mantras while I'm on the MARTA

It's always nitetime in Atlanta
And I'm always awake
Never thought I'd see your face
This far away from home
It's always nitetime in Atlanta
And I'm always awake
Never thought I'd see your face
This far away from home

After we said, "Goodnight"
I was up all night
Couldn't let my body rest
Even though I was tired
Felt the pain all through my legs
And an ache all through my head
Even after we said, "Goodnight"
I was up all night

Amethyst; she rest it on my head when the headache hits
Lemon mint; she mix it in the tea with the turmeric
Edison; showin' me the light I try to let it in
She my Edison for stayin' parked by my side
I'ma let her let the Tesla whip, the Tesla whip
Charged like moonlight
I'ma let her let the Tesla whip, the Tesla whip

555's, 10's, and 20's
I've had 222 too many four for four's from Wendy's
Three times at least paid for with mostly pennies
Back when Kith was still next door
Before they moved to Bleecker
Charged like the moon or electricians
Charms with the jewels on my neck and wrist
Stones on the twine made an anklet
Whip is so quiet if I'm not on auto pilot I can hear my foot jangling

It's the best time to observe it (Oh, oh)
The moonshine soaked you perfect
The Tesla whip, the Tesla whip
Amethyst; she rest it on my head when the headache hits (When the headache hits)
Lemon mint; she mix it in the tea with the turmeric

You dabbed a napkin on the condensation on the outside of the glass
When I spilt that bit of drank on my lap and my hip
You started pattin' me clean
I hope this stains as bad as can be
You spilled drank on you too
While you was too busy laughing at me
Mean I knew you was cute, cute and mean
I mean still you mean the world to me

Amethyst; she rest it on my head when the headache hits
Lemon mint; she mix it in the tea with the turmeric
Edison; showin' me the light I try to let it in
She my edison for stayin' parked by my side
I'ma let her let the Tesla whip, the Tesla whip
Charged like moonlight
I'ma let her let the Tesla whip, the Tesla whip

It's the best time to observe it (Oh, oh)
The moonshine soaked you perfect
The Tesla whip, the Tesla whip
Soft and sweet
Soft and sweet
Soft and sweet
Get up
(Soft and sweet)
Even in Paris I was sad
(Soft and sweet)
She said she won't never leave my side
(Soft and sweet)
Raised her like my son
Shine on me like sun

Sometimes I say I hate my life
I'm only joking I'll be alright
I know better I'll be alright
But if you call and I don't answer
Don't be scared tiny dancer
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
Last night I almost crashed my car
Saw your name glowing in the dark
You thought of me in the nick of time
It's almost morning in New York
And it's been a minute since we spoke
You talk me like you're by my side

Don't talk like that she said, she said
She said it makes her sad
Don't talk like that she said, "Be glad"
Don't talk like that she said, she said
She said it makes her sad
Don't talk like that she said, "Be glad"
"'Cause you got what you have"

She said, "I pray for your vocal chords"
It's no easy job to connect
(Raised her like my son)
Such a hectic heart and such a heavy head
Such a heavy heart with such a hectic head
Felt when it dropped, heavy
Pit of my stomach, belly
Always there for me, deli
It'll all be okay, it'll all be okay
Balance how I feel the weight
Tellin' me to see the good in the bad
Tellin' me to stop settin' traps
Even in Paris I was sad
Choked, tense; nows, thens
Even when they're handing me the bag
Time spent; fashion sense
Put me back together again
Always the seamstress for the band
A steady cure for my shaky hands
It's the way she talk and things she says

Don't talk like that she said, she said
She said it makes her sad
Don't talk like that she said, "Be glad"
"'Cause you got what you have"
Don't talk like that she said, she said
She said it makes her sad
Don't talk like that she said
"You don't know what you have"
"You don't know what you have"
"You don't know what you-"

Even in Paris I was sad

I moved you into your apartment
You made room inside your closet
Just for me and my shit
Just for me and my shit

Cautious
You say I'm being too cautious
You know I hate oversteppin'
You're using that as a weapon

I just got so used to stressin'
Didn't know what to do, I was guessin'
Til you showed me love and affection
Told me "walk in the room like you're sent in"

You make me glad I'm me
You make me glad I'm me
I like the chemistry

I liked her musically first
You make me wanna speak up
You make me wanna speed up

I like how you're leanin on me
My feet know what to do if they gotta take the lead, aye

So smart
How do you know all the stuff that you know, ah
It's divine
And it's only directed at me half the time

Clouds crowing just to cry
Comets coming to get clean
Scrub the sky like I brush my teeth
Meteors showerin' just like me

Meteors showering just like me
Meteors showering just like me
Meteors showering just like me
Meteors showering just like me

What if all the stars and astronomy were already inside of me yeah
What if all the causes of all my grief were like luggage I brought with me everywhere

LA VIE

Runnin through the valley where I live there is no valleys
No peaks or pep rallies, pyramids or keepin' tally
Shopping lists to keep me hungry, lots of shit to carry
Spend a moment with me mama call me papa let's get married

My life is not the stablest, but it's legendary
Spend my time snacking and stacking and fielding surprise drop-bys by fairies
All in third eye, pineal, pituitary

All in alignment that's true, probably planetary too
If it comes into your orbit, is it your weight to carry? hmm
Sip slow, feel the water to the molecules
Started bringing veggies to every barbecue huh

It's no socks feel the grass how it wants to be felt
It's more than batteries that are designed rechargeable so
Sip slow feel the water to the molecules
Save a little for the animals, yeah yeah

So smart
How do you know all the stuff that you Know ah
It's divine
And it's only directed at me half the time

Clouds crowing just to cry
Comets coming to get clean
Scrub the sky like I brush my teeth
Meteors showerin' just like me

Meteors showering just like me
Meteors showering just like me
Meteors showering just like me
Meteors showering just like me

Somethin' cosmic this way comes
Finally somethin' more than zeroes & ones
You thought you had me at the point of your gun
Wonder what you thought was up when I didn't run

Supersonic
Finally somethin movin' faster than you
Something seismic
Plate tectonics
Can't see how they move but you know that they do

Imma fuck wichu
Come here slowly
Touch my Body
When you hold me (mm mm)
When you hold me (hums)
Touch my body

We were rollin palm trees
Underneath the palm trees
You were lappin on me
Mmhmm

Pool on top of me
Wonder how it don't leak
Roof on gotta freeze
But not under palm trees

Don't know why but I trust you
That night our blood was just bug food
That night our hearts went from tough like Carhartt
To I love you
That night I still remember the look on yo face when I dropped the top and it was not no sunroof
It became our couch I had never been so comfortable
Laid there so long I grew stubble
Awoooo

Don't know why you tried them all on
I'm outside waiting for you I got NPR on
It's summertime but I got spring and fall on
I'm calming down yeah, I'm calming down in Comme des Garcons

Down to the ads on the buildings
I swear it's you while I'm looking
(In Comme des garçons)

Pulled up I was with ya

You wanna know about a key bump I don't really know if that'll feed ya

That's how I'm tryna live my life

And I can’t miss ya
When I miss me
And I would fix ya
But I’m breaking
Our days are numbered
But who’s counting
And like the summer
I’m sizzling
You been cooking me with your eyes
Hungry stomach, up all night
I been waiting for you to crack a smile but i just don’t think you like
To show your teeth off even though they shine or your Reebok’s Even though they’re all pumped up
I like 'em more when they’re all scuffed up
You like me more when I’m all fucked up

And I can’t miss ya
When I miss me
And I would fix ya
But I’m breaking
Our days are numbered
But who’s counting
And like the summer
I’m sizzling

You got me down bad down bad but I’m tryna get up

Lately I been battin' down the hatches
I ain't never felt protected I been down bad down bad but I’m tryna get up

Lately I been sleeping on a mattress It’s been good but I still got the fire in me like a matchstick cuz I'm down bad tryna get up

"Cinch"

To me it's a cinch
Watching them tryna do me is so cringe

I've seen this way too many times
She told me I told her to remind me
Not to let it get to me inside
When they tryna copy the glow it just shows you that you're shining
To me it's a cinch
Watching them tryna do me is so cringe

All my exes want me dead
But still show up to the shows just to mess up with my head
I forgot the songs I wrote
I forgot what we last said gave you a hug and had to go
But I woulda loved some head
All blue faces in front row those are not things you can copy
I get shivers when you're talking it's like you're having all my conversations without me
All my passwords still the same
I trust your aim
You couldn't be me if my passport said your name

To me it's a cinch
Watching them tryna do me is so cringe

I've seen this way too many times
She told me I told her to remind me
Not to let it get to me inside
When they tryna copy the glow it just shows you that you're shining
To me it's a cinch
Watching them tryna do me is so cringe

I was tryna keep it tucked but you brought it to the surface
I won't do it all at once I keep summ saved on purpose
Stayed this way since I was young and they stay way too observant
It feel fake
When they do it it don't ache
8 at once in my mind going ape
Bait it once see the line pull straight
How'd you find it did it feel like fate or all along it was right in your face

We could go again
To the spot where we liked last time
I bet it's no different
We can go again
All our friends are missing but
I bet it's no different ah-
We can go again
The songs prolly changed since then
But we can still dance the same as when we came and went
We should go again
Our feet been draggin instead of toe tappin

We said we'd go until we can't go
Had too much time to tango
All caught up and now it's tangled
We said we'd go until we can't go

I done finally scrubbed the dirt off
Cuz you never reached me
You know I been worse off
First of all
But I heard you swerve off
From the driveway where you keep me
Must've been a long way home

Life is good, who's askin'?
Wrote my number down on too many napkins
Got tired of, "we'll see what happens"
Lights, camera, she 'bout that action

Which is good when I'm stagnant
And stuck to the mattress, stuck like a magnet
Life is good, but it's taxin'
Discourse, distractions
Discotheque, mathematics
Gave her my number after dancin'
Life is good, who's askin'?
You are not entitled to my time or my passion
Nights out ran me ragged
Got tired of bein' nice out of habit
You can ask, you can't have it
Shorty back home snack wrapped in a blanket

Life is good, who's askin'?
Wrote my number down on too many napkins
Got tired of, "we'll see what happens"
Lights, camera, she 'bout that action
Life is good, who's askin'?

She ask in Spanish
Can't understand it, still, somehow it's magic
Gave up on fashion
Changed up my balance, ate a salad
She got me Nikes, we went hiking
We got Popeye's, hopped a red-eye
We caught sunrise out in Bedstuy
Know her bedtime I slip out the crib too late, I meet my fate
That's bad for me, a casualty, say it's a meeting, it's a date
Feel like a dog, set my alarm for 5am, and then I left
Snuck into bed, disturbed her breath
I attest it's better to have loved and lost
Than to never have loved anything at all
But I loved it all too much and now I gotta fall
'Cause it's far

It's been good, shouldn't complain
But even when I win, I'm drained
I know I'm only gon' be sad again
'Cause none of this is permanent

Life is good, who's askin'?
Wrote my number down on too many napkins
Got tired of, "we'll see what happens"
Lights, camera, she 'bout that action

She think it's funny how
We always spendin' money goin' out
All the while we
Have everything we need at home
Now she
Wants me to start goin' out alone
So I drive away, smile on my face
